it's nice it really is yeah we're talking though uh on my you know i don't really know i knew when i bought it but i don't know right now i've got a little program uh genealogy program called Family Ties
when i do um crochet it's usually the lacy Victorian type
the uh costs are just going out of sight and and uh you know it's either increase the premiums or try to uh everybody work together to try to curtail the cost that's the way i see it
because i have never i have never let me reword that i think i have gone home maybe once or twice slightly sore but that's because of my physical condition and nothing to do what they did
you know or anything like that but it it's really bad here i mean to me it is it seems like people just don't care anymore they say huh well it don't make any difference you know one crook is as good as the other one and they don't bother to listen to what any of them have to say
i work at the Lewisville site
to uh to get out and uh go for the swim i think uh there is something to this endorphins
well even the you know the non exempts technically yet we haven't had our salary frozen yet
the jury would would slam them and and i think that that the jury probably has more of a right to sentence than the judge all the time
they're being recorded and uh oh put in uh i guess in Washington DC somewhere for reference for speech projects
well i guess it's kind of like watching a ballgame uh or or sports if you're not if you're not interested in the game you wouldn't you don't care whether you see it or not
yeah exactly that's what everyone says
yeah but uh you know  it's uh i guess the difficulty would be to  somebody could obviously just take it right off the tailpipe again so you'd probably have to build it right into the muffler or something
uh-huh yeah i think uh Central America has always been one of those places where people are more passive you know where it's always the minority that are
just hard finding the time that can be dedicated to that
he'd be lucky if he can get an assistant uh job someplace
it was just wonderful to be able to get out and hit a ball the course was not not green but it was going to be in another month when they started watering
yeah yeah and the one in Mesquite is um Scyene exit
oh forty five fifty miles away
like uh say we're freshly graduated from school and things so we haven't gotten to the point where we're hiring professionals to do too much of our needs do
so who is your favorite football team
and so i got the first choice of the two hundred and fifty dollar bonds so i was in the upper deck in the twelfth row on the fifty yard line i wonder if that guy that's in the eleventh row see he bought thousand dollar bonds
with what i'm involved with doing is kind of a controversial job anyway
well if that's not the problem it
okay fantastic one one thing that pops into my mind real quick is uh about the uh funding of the the school system right now evidently uh that's that's a big problem
so you're making uh you know fifteen dollars profit easily
well we have we have had some medical i mean some military retirees work up here for us or a bunch really and they did use the heck out of the medical
i understand that the MacNeil Lehrer probably doesn't
uh on a seminar for a week
i i don't like really camping in the rough i like the the the little niceties like having electricity available and running water and showers and things like that
people have you know think they're kids have to have five hundred dollars worth of toys
but maybe i'll try it one day
refill our water glasses um someone had only eaten a portion of their food and wanted to take it home and asked to have it boxed and she just pitched it out
i go to school i go to LSU
uh-huh i thought that was illegal
that'd be hard to hard to cover all the ones that go bad
right okay well good talking to you
think that we have gotten into much too legalistic of society and that we we spend far too much on the fine points of the law and far too little on achieving justice
and they said it is so safe there that you can leave your purse on the subway
yeah well you know the interesting thing about i don't know if you've been watching Massachusetts lately um
uh-huh well you know i heard something about that here whether Neil uh here again it may have been Neil Sperry they say you know everybody looks at these oaks and says yeah they grow slow and all that
you have to learn how to do it that's right otherwise they hold it over your head forever right
the household chores and duties and what has to be done so i think over a couple of generations time it will all change because it's really been uh my generation
yeah i change the oil and i do the lubrication
uh you do for classes for classes but to i mean to use any of the facilities is is no extra charge
especially on you know i mean from the inside you know how you look under under something that you've made and it doesn't really
there were several credit cards and then there were several other businesses but uh i i guess what's interesting have you seen the uh the the the the ads where they're offering to extend payments on uh things like uh like the credit union's offering
to help them
yeah so i mean things have just really gone out of sight in the last uh i guess about the last ten years
but i've i've gotten rid of all of the credit cards you know that i possibly could and my balances are practically zero on the ones that i have
it does and and ever once you know on my summer vacation you know my week long vacation i want to be a little bit pampered you know by a hotel or whatever
well do you keep up with the statistical stuff
because they figured everybody else is just coming to just to be there
yeah it's sort of interesting
you're kidding oh that's interesting
now see i would have never figured that i would have figured that to be a lot more than that  for something that's limited edition
you mean like those little thin in the little roll the bellies
probably not no
so i don't think there's ever been a war that's been so thoroughly covered by the news
i everyone has made so many statements i don't live in Dallas county
and when i went over there i packed a lot of clothes and i packed two sport jackets and two ties and the ties got lost and never got there and i was there three years or four years rather and never missed them
where uh you know they plead to a lesser crime or uh they plead guilty in or you know tell about someone else and they they get less time
oh God what a headache what a pain in the butt and
fraud is very difficult to prove
back during the Vietnam conflict that no one will will have the guts enough to call a real war uh
yeah and that's really neat i mean yeah you can do graphs graphs on it too but this is you know this is one step above it but it's actual um drafting and i always
i have watched that yeah that's good
and uh that's what really makes it look professional you can do a lot with the Serger though you can make uh piping and cording and uh you can use all kinds of different uh textures of thread
they will already have in fact i have one myself i'm reluctant to admit
i can't think of her name i got it right on the tip of my tongue and can't say it Helen something
yeah i don't think that some people i don't think have uh a year in them to volunteer if you know what i mean they're not worth it
bargello it's B A R G E double L O
uh we're in no we're in uh where they call it now north Potomac it's it's a  town but it's close to Potomac
well i i i think one of the big problems i mean looking at it from the American the American public's standpoints they don't understand the Middle Easterners
so we we do that somewhat uh we also have uh teleconferencing where we have
we bought that and it was uh the paint was uh so-so i had scraped i had to do a lot of scraping and then i put uh uh water base paint over the uh oil
no i think it's good in fact uh i don't know what the statistics were but i think that they were very surprised to find it so low i think they were expecting it to find uh like the national average at TI and i think it was tremendously down i think
last night we went out and people we were with she uh had fajitas and she had this pepper on the plate and maybe she thought it was a sweet pepper but  it wasn't and she ate it and i was wondering why her eyes were watering
uh-huh sure if you had to have a drug test yeah
no no i didn't even miss work just sling stick it in a sling and go on
there's lots of shades of greens
oh okay um-hum exactly and it seems like everything is raising every everything that can be cigarette not that i smoke but cigarettes
it was very expensive because the whole time you were on there you were on long distance you know it was like a long distance phone call so we were each limited limited to like twenty minutes a day you know so
it must be either uh A  and E or um uh Discovery Discovery
and yeah and you just have to keep buying them you know if you if you if you're not buying the most expensive clothes out there the the quality is really not that great you know for the price that you pay
so it's it's a really tough question
yeah yeah like New York was really humid you know you but you could you could walk around outside in New York you could just stay outside in in it you know because it was i guess the average summer temperature is about eighty uh you know in the eighties
right and it's one of those things it's it's it's so hard to measure uh what what what the damage is it's it's kind of like uh
well Steve it's been nice talking with you
well see um and i worked for a steel mill the past two summers
i have a friend who um she had a she had a baby a little boy and uh she she used to dress him out of Neiman Marcus i mean she dressed him
yeah um-hum just water
yes i think most states do have capital punishment yes
yeah because so is it like for example you test a chip
yeah yeah yeah she liked it and she wants to go back up there and and uh look around you know just sight see
do you that's neat so you kind of uh uh an everyday camper
i didn't yes
so you think like CIA influence and our money over there
well you now they're especially the older one uh they they're into their sports and their friends a lot you know the younger one's getting into it more uh what we enjoy doing with them which we started a year ago was um we go on fishing you know day time trips with them the younger one especially is really good at it he enjoys fishing um they like to go to a place here called uh Chuckie Cheese which is really like a crazy arcade type of thing has a lot of games um and we you know we like to do outdoors types of things with them um
oh well we all indulge right
and it was just you know twenty twenty miles from me
no i live in San Antonio
and the judge was extremely concerned for our welfare if we were well if we were comfortable and uh things of that nature which made us feel good
and because he doesn't hit the North Dallas traffic and all then he might have worked an hour late it was just like ah we had so many things to do and we just couldn't get them done and i i remember thinking that man it i'm a Christian and i really feel like we have a responsibility to vote but i tell you what if i wasn't a Christian i would there's no way i would have gone to vote just because of the pressures
yeah it seems like i heard that just this week on either CNN or somewhere that they they were talking about that
when i know what the oil costs
and you want to use one of your good sauce pans that dissipate the heat because it it ends up burning i mean no matter how careful you are you still might get a film on the bottom of the pot i don't let that worry me and i get the milk lukewarm and then i pour about a half a cup of cornstarch in it and i have this thing it's called the slender blender
yeah probably because you said retirement and that really has not even occurred to me once
today is his birthday yeah yeah
now that's a thought well that's a thought i hadn't thought about doing that
oh oh i would think so but they've been married almost thirty five years so i think they've done things like that to each other for a long time
what he'll be able to do he's been last year he started having some nagging injuries and
yeah well no wonder they're out of it
we we my sister uses plenty of fertilizer i don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing boy i wish this phone would stop screeching
well um i just bought a home so i've just now went out and purchased my brand new lawn mower and um so i've been assembling it and haven't had a chance to get out there and and test it out
um-hum that's kind of sad well anyway well i guess i better go
my folks have just retired just in the last couple of months my dad has and uh they're trying to figure out you know what they're doing with stuff and my mom's in there cutting up the credit cards  you know can't use these anymore and
so they tend to be more cooperative with their peer group although they don't have real good uh role models
what kind of --
yeah oh that sounds good well  every once in a while i i think i feel the same way when i'm entertaining i don't take that thing into consideration unless it's really really like a lot of women will turn down dessert if it's too rich simply because they don't want the extra calories so i think dessert is the only thing that i kind of down play sometimes
okay did it work out your first time all right
they're half they're team is going to be gone now and see that's another thing for next year with UNLV they're not going to have no team
uh you may be called up twenty times and one person will only be called up once but uh
they can go ahead and use it then or they can just wait the full year and then have two
well yeah that is it's mountainous and uh but it
yeah yeah i think so too but you know it's one of those things
now they don't want the money for food that's for sure
it's always they're always challenging to get through one of them i have a hard time finishing books
yeah same thing here
yeah right and uh you know they we you know we go to the park or we go in the backyard and sit down and
yeah because i think that if they if they tried for independence they would probably have uh
but you know critically acclaimed oh good grief give me a break
yes i i was i was flabbergasted and i think plastic was um plastic never totally total breaks down
and so we're going to use people that we're in a relationship with that we know that you know we know are people of integrity so
and when when we started uh having kids she had to work for a little while but then she just started substituting
it may be a much reduced force than what we used to have over there but you still better have the key players in place if something does go down even if it's a regional conflict if United States is going to flex its muscle and be the super power that it is not only does it it can talk the talk but it's got to be able to walk the walk it's got to have the stuff to back it back up what it's saying if you've only got a token force there you can't hold your ground
a store in my house where i've got the uh the hardware and the software and i also do repair work on the system if if i started using a different computer at home then i wouldn't be using the the software and the hardware and it would be that much more difficult for me to try and market it the the product
that's true that's true plus a lot of movies you need to sort of see them in a theater you know it just makes them that much better
uh sort of pull yourself up by your boot straps and do what you really wanna do  convincing you that you need to get on with it
well i know there there's got to be a lot of uses but it's just you you have to have a need
no and it's nice i'm just inside the city limits i'm probably a mile mile and a half inside the city limits and i'm only a mile and a half from work
and uh no oh there i don't i don't think i don't think there is any pay wait i'm not sure because what happens is you get to like to ride buses for free
yeah hum that's good that's that's that's that's actually real good
sure they should have them go out and doing stuff cleaning up or picking up dirt or weeds or who knows what something for the for the state since the state is paying for them they should get some kind of kind of work out of them
oh God oh man this is too scary that is just too scary you know i let Brian play here in the back yard and we've got
mostly just stuff that i can you know use right around the house
oh okay oh we um we use it's an IBM PS two also
yeah well i i have another thing that i thought about too um for instance when you try to save money and you earn interest on whatever your investment is and you know we're not typically talking about big dollars but here you feel like you've you've done something good you've you've earned your interest and then you have to go back and pay taxes on it so the real amount of your savings on that is is not much
he goes to a really crummy day school uh my sister's not real bright so but he he's always sick i mean he has always got some kind of cold or something and i don't know i don't think this place is a very good place for him
probably ninety percent of the aluminum cans do have deposits because they're beer and soda but when they sell juice it's some strange quirk in the law you don't have to have a deposit on it and even like the you know a very fine juice jar does not have to have a deposit on it but if it's got soda in it it does so it's a strange
and no i i don't know that we'd ever be able to get to that point but uh um but it's something to work for
and you know it showed her trying to explain to her children where daddy is you know and it was just oh it was just
and it was so funny the other day i took some guys to to lunch and when we came back they said oh there's a parking space real close and i parked way out in the boonies and i said you can walk off your lunch
dammed up the uh White River real pretty in Arkansas lake but we are hoping to explore a lot of the lakes around Texas and just stay close to home
yeah it was it was fun because uh they would call when they were with the Browns they would call and say we left tickets at the gate for you all come on up so we would hop in the car the next morning and drive up and
well what what's your perspective on it
it was same time period yes
well so do we in fact when we first got married we would try to take these trips to Minnesota to see his family
and so it was you know we just went from one extreme to the other you know and it was like kind of sad it was like man this is really hard you know i want to watch the war and so
that i think that was the most difficult thing for people to pick up on was stopping and starting people's pay mainly because you can do it now and it's easy and it's so easy that people go
yeah hey that's kind of sad
well i the biggest uh way it's going right now uh lot most of the grocery stores
uh well i i like i said i've done mechanics all my life and i do that with the company so uh i'm a senior engineer for them so i am mechanics and i i just uh i enjoy it i really it's like a diversion for me i i think if i had to do it
yeah it it is interesting to watch that water rise all of a sudden
how are you tonight
well no i just mean that that the world in general
oh they didn't say they didn't say what though they just said they thought it was
yeah yeah yeah yeah surprise surprise
absolutely absolutely now i can't wait for uh i i could just picture what's what's going to happen here in the not to distant future we keep hearing well we're going to receive uh eight billion dollars from Japan for the uh uh uh the uh uh the the the big war over there in the Mideast
quite creative and appealing to the younger crowd
and once they do that then people will be more interested right now it doesn't matter how much garbage you put out to the road it's a flat fee a month
but now their saying that they're there really not that much in comparison to the others because you don't have to use the water to wash them and you know all different kinds of things too so
yeah well see that was that's another if i would have been home probably wouldn't have watched it because i have class tonight and i would have missed the second half and that's the most frustrating because that's you know you can if you missed the first half
i've i've heard i've heard that that is a really
but all those you know just monthly payments and stuff that just go out the door and there's big chunks of your money to pay like the utilities and the gas and the groceries and stuff that you don't have tangible i mean the perishable kind of things that's gone used and gone
and they actually had lentils which some stores don't have things like that you know which
oh this this comes with the blade on it you mean uh-huh
yeah yeah yeah uh i'm a member of an HMO and uh from all indications it's quite similar to the military
yeah that's true there are there is a little segment little segment up near McKinney and up near um uh they said out near Wylie there's some some little areas where the soil is completely sandy and then it it uh goes back into the black gumbo around it
and that was so nice but we didn't have that luxury so we were dragging the the sprinkler around everywhere and uh
and he says that what i do is i'm actually crossing the plain is what this is his words his technical words for it crossing yeah
yeah so you know who's who produces those the US produces those and i think after the war no that we're not going to see a bunch of the Arab nations buying Russian equipment because the Russian equipment has gotten blown out of the sky or off the ground
they come up real pretty every year no problem
they're on backwards huh oh jeez all that work and
yeah uh i'm in uh New York upstate upstate upstate New York yeah and uh  long way uh
there's there's it's at that was actually a big dilemma for me now because um Cheers
but i uh what i did with my garden is i have a a two by six frame that's five by ten i have two of them sitting side by side
is it is it a hundred percent or is it fifty percent
well something that i really don't understand is when someone goes to jail
we've got too many uh uh uh immigrants
oh i'm sure i i think you would probably
i don't care
right yeah because we don't you know we don't charge anything that we can't pay off by the end of the month
it was unusual not to have the different sources you know of news coverage
do they have uh actual camp sites there where you can go and
oh i know i can't imagine even well that would it is just pretty bad but so i guess um
and so they say well this is you know i i don't know if they say it's the first time offense or whatever but they give him a lighter sentence thinking he's not a habitual criminal
and boy the price of toys these days is ridiculous
Central America have you ever lived in Central America
uh and i i think that's probably the fun of watching minor league baseball and the other thing is watching guys on the other end uh guys that i had seen play for both the Red Sox and Pittsburgh
play-off games and stuff like that
well that's kind of the way i was i tried to remember as i took stuff off where it went and i don't think i had too many nuts and bolts left over when i got it all put back together
and she watches she watches these really gross things you know like The Nightmare on Elm Street and the you know that kind of junk i don't go for that at all
um-hum yeah i've i've gone in the past years from uh having a wicked slice to having a wicked hook to back to having a wicked slice i mean it's just uh
that's right and and i don't know i i think that i i think i think the Federal government is going to more or less leave it alone i think they've got i think there are more pressing problems
and uh you know they absolutely no regulations no controls whatsoever and they had destroyed entire forests and what not just because the air was so polluted that's that's the kind of things that uh you don't see in this country and that's that's why i think that you know it's it's i don't know if you can ever do enough but uh i think it's all relative to the to the time and place and i think right now it's it's it's pretty much under control
yeah i had a friend who lived in Dumas
okay well i used to hate Star Trek
you know i wonder sometimes wonder if i'll ever if i will regret it when i'm old but uh i just can't see myself as a parent
it's it's kind of nice to be able to do both and uh i'll probably be doing that for a few years now until the kids get old enough to stay by themselves
but some tell stories you know some are serious some are funny um but uh there all there all fun to watch they're they're full you know they're for adults they're not just kids cartoons they're they're genuine stories and things
oh i i'm actually right on the Plano line
but but you'd think that uh garages could do that
and i i it was uh really odd but we went home to Missouri at at at Christmas and i we had well we ran into town and in the ice
that's great i'd forgotten all about the Texan side and that's but you got to be a member of Texans to use it
yeah what do you think about a state income tax
but well hey i appreciate the conversation
and the other one's
or a Black woman named Rodriguez
i i don't know it's going to be hard to switch i think that we're going eventually end up end up that way though i just don't see how we can yeah i think it'll take
oh well no uh it  i think that's a really bad plan in your budgeting if you have to pay one card off with another oh eventually eventually
everybody in the country like i i lived in Denmark for a couple of years
yeah there's a lady here in uh Dallas who started a mozzarella or a cheese company can't remember the name of it and she's a multimillionaire from it and i i just think God if only it could be me
once the pressure gets turned on they they seem to loose it see that's the typical trait of the Dallas Cowboys and and the Oklahoma Sooners it's funny over the years
so it's it's more like living with a big in a big house where it's your turn to to set the table like you're saying or whatever instead of being waited on hand and foot all the time yeah that would be nice
yeah yeah but then you know too on a it's uh of course what i think about when we talk about immigrants i know they're coming from everywhere but i think a lot about coming from Mexico because i guess i'm so close to that and if they close the well the borders are closed basically i mean they're but we get all these people that come in illegally and stay
yeah and you know and it there are many of them there's no doubt about it
and what will a shot be will a shot be an ounce
because someone might see something that you don't see i mean you know they may have they may have picked up on something that gave them that doubt that
and i don't know if that's just a pure volumes number or or what but uh sometimes i think the jury is ignorant in the facts of law and how things should be determined and they're too easily swayed by their emotion
yeah yeah well yeah i hope that it does for her she deserves it she's a nice person
uh no they i'm in telecommunications company and they uh sent it out in our bulk mail so that if any engineers want to participate you know
but uh huh-uh not yet but i mean i don't know whether they have one of the first you know choices of somebody that would be real good
yeah yes uh too much we give away way too much in my in my opinion
so we got into it fairly cheaply and then uh after we sold the first house we were left with enough cash that there was enough to make the down payment on this house
no direct communication no show of affection no even no show of anger unless it he was you know really really drunk
yeah his age is about to catch up with him though
yeah yeah yeah i agree with you i i'm glad you mentioned that because i think i have to since i don't have the opportunity in the morning i'll probably catch the the head lines on T News that's a good point
yeah Lilly yeah Lilly she she said i said it's for it's for your daughter to use oh no she said i know she doesn't get to touch it she hung it on the wall
right because you always think i mean i don't know maybe you don't but just like me i always think well you know these things must be safe but that's just like i don't know if you've heard about it a few years ago they said you know before they had the like the shoulder strap thing where it was just like a seat belt that goes across your waist
i guess you keep those things you grew up with i worked in uh Missouri for a while and uh i was probably the only one in the room several times when we were watching football on TV when the Cowboys were playing the Saint Louis Cardinals and i was rooting for the Cowboys
you know well in California too i've got a friend that lives out there and uh she's got a little two three bedroom house with a garage a double car garage and it's costing her a thousand dollars a month
to um make and everything and it's usually well liked by people i guess i'm just a seafood fan so i think on the lines
right well that's true that's true if you have to get a babysitter and everything else yeah
i work in uh building twelve in Attleboro
really i would have thought that was close enough that
oh that's right i think now that i recall reading about it in the paper
not without  wiping out a whole generation of of kids in the school system and so
but uh we saw Avalon and uh i think we went in to see Avalon because we couldn't get in to maybe we wanted to go see Ghost and couldn't get into Ghost because the line you know they sold out
i'm not sure um what exactly is wrong with her um up until nineteen eighty two uh actually i'm sorry not until yeah i guess it was around eighty two eighty three i found out i had a grandmother
well see i didn't either until it happened
but i had another career first and then came to TI a little later
they're preparing people for the test by having a class specifically for the test how ridiculous i mean of course it has the highest
yeah i love watching that then i like watching their bloopers too you know
i realize that that i mean i can take that for granted but i used to i used to live in India and things are quite different there in terms of that there's less of a sense of privacy in fact it's said that no Indian language has a word for privacy certainly a language i know doesn't but just has a word for loneliness loneliness is the closest you can come which is really quite different
he was always speaking in terms of you know American imperialism reasserting itself and i suppose it's a different attitude that we normally don't hear in the country
so uh but really the when it when it gets uh nasty down here it's like a big huge fender bender parking lot so i just try
they those have been real popular with my family i've had them calling up and saying will you make me another one and
yeah course the ozone is up there so
yeah do do you work for TI in any way
hi how you doing
and there's some kind of a boot that had had come off the car so the emergency brake froze on
i think if anybody has a doubt you need to yeah i do feel that yes i really do
and they have a a problem their their whole attitude um i i'm not sure which crop it was but they had a crop that rotted in the fields because they couldn't get anyone to harvest it
i don't know they it Schwartzkopf Schwartzkopf knew what had to be done and it's too bad that he just didn't have the ability just to do it to you know the uh the go ahead to do it
uh-huh uh-huh i'm kind of at the other extreme i have a nine month old and one that will be born in October
uh playing such
um-hum yeah once in a while uh my i have an American Express they have this  a buyer protection thing
when that first came out i really did not expect the special effects or anything like that i mean
one of them is right out there close to us they're in the process of building it up right now i know
they have uh twenty seven computers for each of the little labs and each lab serves uh two grades so the first and second graders have their own batch of computers that they've cycled the kids through and
i mean a lot of people bitch and moan about the taxes and all but are so are they willing to pay for you know
and still are yes
yeah yeah ours is seven point seven five almost eight and it drives me crazy i'm thinking you know everybody is sitting here screaming about
well it's sure been nice visiting with you
no we haven't um
yeah fifty nine cents yeah so you knows yeah it's it's something that you know we we go there every Sunday  me and my roommate go there every Sunday you know with our hangover
no no because if you go back there then you can never get out
that you know put give out uh nonbiased information just general information on how the candidates stand on certain issues that you know you can make a decision on how you feel about certain issues and who you want
and that's it and we had a bar man from here in Dallas area that made it there is a woman that uh made
yeah i mean here you are you got you know you got showers and stoves and refrigerators and TV's and air conditioning
i like everything but jazz
it was funny i i spent a a year overseas a few years ago and all the TV was i was in Japan and all the TV shows were in Japanese
uh-huh yeah yeah they everything starts at eight and then it goes through ten and uh i don't think Johnny Carson comes on until like eleven
i don't know what they call them but i'm plagued with those things down here and i haven't figured out i even called the nursery either though see
yeah that area and it's really small all all you have is like towns built around universities like Chapel Hill
but there's always a sell
i have some do you
so i i wouldn't tolerate that
right i think it's seven here or seven point something
that's true  good point
and started being bought out by families and things and she started having fewer and fewer friends
i like Italian food
uh to one level down from assistant description
well that that that that will make their day
yeah just so that my kids would would have me at home
yeah Um i don't know i think we should have helped the the innocent people in Iraq out a little bit more than rather than just quitting where we did
uh-huh which is very difficult to do
Dead Dead Zone that's one i liked
she got that scholarship
and i think that's all they're picking up but you know like in Minnesota they've got those bins where you put your plastics and your bottles
so uh we you know we get a lot of bad weather in this area but of course you're supposed to be the sun belt and i do know that you get some freezing weather down there on occasion
it could be an interesting
talk to you later Janet bye-bye
yeah and and that's appropriate if the university is trying to do serious research because it's hard to be a researcher and a teacher at the same time
and that's that's really neat
oh yeah that's great too uh-huh yeah we did some remodeling when we bought a house we built put a kitchen in and um that kind of stuff and painting and some wallpapering that's fun it is it really is
yeah and he is a a cutie and uh but i've never had a dog i had to keep taking to the groomer's to have groomed either and it's
you know i i feel like if something happens uh that causes an accident you ought to test the parties involved immediately just just if if nothing else to rule it out
uh-huh yeah i know they don't write anything like they used to the classics
um i'm not sure if your familiar with the movement they have here in Maryland but they're trying to get a uh a uh a merit system here in Maryland rather than a uh tenure system
well you know it's interesting what they've been what they have what has really caught on here is mall walking
and i even lubricate the car myself because i have a i have means of of running it up on on jack stands and and you know i have a creeper and i crawl around underneath it so it's not a big deal
yeah well uh you know if it hadn't been for that i guess i wouldn't be here because  my family came from France and uh one side and one side came from Germany so
and it still would have been every bit as accessible a movie for the kids if they had included all this stuff that i anyway as an as intellectual adult would appreciate it wouldn't have hurt the movie to do that and it would have make it uh broadened the audience that it could have been targeted for i thought but i um i'm i'm clearly enough you know i'm i'm clearly an intellectual snob to be going to these kinds of movies i realize that
there's a point where the uh the show is about these uh catatonic type people that this doctor discovers a drug that brings them back to the the living more or less
so that was yeah yeah right really or live really close to school and have them walk
um who has nothing to hide would object
oh okay well i'm a Tech graduate so
back in August when all of the news and all of the media began to focus in on um Iraq and the so the last thing that i remember hearing that much about is the Iran-Contra scandal that happened in the Reagan presidency can you think of anything else that's happened recently
let me just quick catch it and i'll be back
are you are you how about that well we're all lots of people from TI up this way
um-hum but uh you know he's got uh millions of dollars like
uh-huh and so eventually they were forced to put her
you know well i mean there's like when when you realize  teachers one of my teachers got this computer and it was like voice synthesis and stuff
oh it's been beautiful here lately
that's what we we got rid of an American Express card for the same reason is though we have a a credit union and we get our cards our other MasterCards for free so we don't have to pay a a fee at all
yeah i think so right yeah he sure did
hopefully we'll have some more good weather but
oh yeah well you have to see them more than that i i i still catch things in Airplane that i didn't catch
yeah i think i can agree with that too
yes especially the murder rate its just gone crazy
uh-huh sure absolutely and there's just you know the two of us my wife and i and it's amazing how much stuff just just the two of us generate you know i can imagine a family of you know four or five
i've had i've had that meal in New York uh where they bring you a plank sort of with all this wonderful beef parts of beef cooked and barbecued and it's marvelous uh i have
yeah well tell me about your van do you like it
well i sew
and i'm definitely not a soap fan
uh Mike Ditka i don't like the way he treats people
i think it's unfortunate uh as far as the Kurds are concerned it
part part of the problem too i think up here is i mean um
yeah i don't believe they have to pay any uh like federal tax uh
pinks and greens yeah
i think they want a one world order that's what i think i think Gorbachev would like to see a one world order a one world economic community and a one world government with him in charge of it and Bush is going around talking about it too
i didn't make it i sort of washed out
well the the legal system in this country has gone to such extreme measures they've swung so far away from
i've got all my gas cards because i don't want to carry money around i'll do that
it's like if you drew a line from Austin straight down it would be in that region
yeah they just poop and it's yeah they
yeah yeah did you go with kids though
he he just picks it up over the counter and and i was i was really surprised that there you can get guns of any kind that you want you know the other thing is you had talked about the uh needing a gun to protect yourself and you know maybe someday we're all going to get wiped out by a robber here and then i'll change my mind but
and and and uh one day they'll pick up uh the the cleaning people come through and they'll pick up recycled paper and then the next day they'll pick up the other so
well that that that i guess from the from the card issuer uh that since since it's it's in monitor the parent gets it for them that really the parent becomes the one that's responsible but it's
so you are off to work this morning
racing cars they want Mercedes or Cadillacs or Lincolns
yes i i have my primary experience has been as uh an expert witness and and uh and two murder trials
and i believe in this but
the yours is my second one
don't you how come
yeah right after they started i guess the other uh businesses lost money and they all began doing the same thing
well i don't know but uh i'm twenty two years old and i think it would be uh it's not a good choice to do that i mean you have uh everything here you know like uh the Army and everything else is all all voluntary and that's the way you're going to dedicate yourself
you need to start the grill
uh one parent
right yeah we're just so much wealthier and uh and uh there has to be resentment built up and that's where uh leaders can use uh use that whenever the opportune moment arises
okay what kind of music do you like
yeah i mean you know he's single he's approaching fifty years old
yeah i think that'll be fun so we're going to try to do that like on a three day weekend go there and
and stuff like that and it's got one of those wildlife parks
we both decided on a Devonrex though it's sort of like a Sphinx it's a very short haired cat
it's a good general education education education for a a bachelor's degree
you can go first or i will
i never did get it fixed
yes they do i noticed that they're really putting in small back yards because they have these most of the houses have the alleys that run behind
buy a whole knew metric set yeah well i think you know it's something that's going to take quite some time to happen but i i still don't think that they're doing all that it's going to take to make it happen you know it's going to happen slowly no matter what but there's going to have to be a lot more education involved than there is right now to get it to to get it to switch over
but i'm at the uh Melpar division here in uh Falls Church
well i have kids fortunately that have left grown gone thank heaven
four out of five hurt
a little bit humid clear blue sky and the sunshine and the Rangers don't play many afternoon games because of the heat we have here in the summer
yeah well what they did is just they came in and just cut the glass out of the frame and put more glass in
i guess that was one
you have a good you have a good week
so if they've just taken such action it would seem to indicate to me either they're doing it because they're afraid they might become a state and want to declare this before they become a state or maybe because they don't want to become a state for fear of losing the Spanish or Hispanic heritage
did you ever see the program uh Why Does Johnny Kill
yeah uh i was here in nineteen sixty well i got to go back that i moved down from Pittsburgh in in fifty nine and uh in fifty eight i really became a pro football fan went to all the Steelers home games
that's where you swim you do not swim in the ocean
and there's three of us EDP auditors and one of the three of us has an accounting background and so she's not real proficient in PCs and the other
as little as possible  i'm a college student
kill  right
oh i would imagine helping them feel good about themselves they're at a bad stage anyway and then to have to deal with sexual abuse would be terrible as a teen
oh Lewisville  any decent food in your cafeteria up there
they seem to be really durable
and then the United States has this attitude by saying you know thank you for keeping us our freedom and stuff like that and i think it's all independent because it's it has nothing to do with the United States you didn't gain anything from it
so slow i guess they're stoned on the stuff or something
right and i was i was going to school in his prime back when we had Archie Griffin and we were winning all the Heisman trophies and going to Rose Bowl that was when i was going to school there
and we have a a company that collects it and takes care of that that for us uh in the community um Baltimore County that i that's the county i used to live in um they just started experimenting with uh trash pickup where uh one day a week they pick up recycled items and then another day a week they pick up the other trash and uh they've uh contracted with a company here that has a special truck that has different containers on the same truck you know one that holds paper one that holds plastic one that holds tin one that holds aluminum and uh so they've they've started experimenting with doing it um on a very large scale also in Baltimore City they've started doing it uh there's been a lot of awareness um especially here on the east coast because our landfills are you know so filled now that uh there's just not enough room for all the garbage that we uh that we create
they have had some absolutely wonderful shows and they do they have incredibly good what are called production values they have
because it's far more advantageous for them to sit there and just draw uh welfare money than it is to work uh we did a uh a cost comparison in one of my courses and we took all the benefits that a family that a a married couple with two kids would get under welfare and what they would be making at minimum wage and they came out four thousand dollars better a year by taking welfare
see i i agree with that yeah
i think that uh it does goes a lot toward uh you know like you say it gives people a kind of a makes them insensitive to it and
yeah yeah i watched that cause he was cute
oh okay i have three yeah yeah uh do you work
and and do you know anything about that new stadium have you seen all those pictures that they're going to put out there
normally i listen to CNN or Headline News about an hour a day and then i supplement that with uh radio news from my car radio and from a news magazine once a week
uh she thinks it's pretty funny how often i know all of the words to songs that she's listening to and yet she thought they were brand new original pieces
we have had no snow to speak of to speak of
loves that's right loves the little dog loves to travel of course she's dead asleep before we get to the end of the block and she never you know she sleeps the whole time but she loves to travel
no see i was i've been working for TI for almost eight years
you know i i don't normally do that at at work uh and i i typically deal with uh
you know it's you're you're taking words and developing a picture in your mind
yes i i think they can probably come up with some ways to insure that uh you know people would get a fair trial and not have to go through this process
um and he had to past and he told them remember  remember you
um when i was in the Air Force i used to be up in South Dakota
uh undergrad degree in political science and then a master's in public administration And i went ahead and pursued that i i got as far as the thesis and decided To hell with it i didn't want it
uh Mike Ditka i don't like the way he treats people
yeah they sure develop their own interests
oh yeah it has to be reinforced in the home
so i i predominantly wear flat shoes um you know in the winter i wear sweaters in the summer i you know i like one piece dresses short sleeves things like that
that's true i do the same thing what types of crafts do you do
now we have peach trees coming up
that's kind of scary to me that kind of to me it is more like  vigilantism
i find that when you order a salad at a restaurant you don't really get a salad you get like lettuce and you know what i mean and the croutons
so many of my crafts well right now i'm looking at a little uh quilted uh uh hanging it's like it's a flag and i don't want to wash it because that would start breaking down the batting and so forth but it's such a dust collector to be
the fire power against them now is is atrocious
yes it is it's tornado season
i know he was saying he was so sick of soap operas because i guess for about four years now she you know he'll come home from work and there she'll be watching soap operas yeah
a softball league down in Memphis we went and uh that's the most expensive place we went to
uh but i don't know if they're going to ever give up their careers you know It's sort of like they went to school and they worked so hard to get where they are i don't know if they want to completely give that up
i say we because i live here if that might not turn around in the next you know fifteen twenty years
they don't know how to sit there and look at the interest rate and say well this one is only sixteen percent and this one's twenty two hum
some of our people in the legal department we have um assistants to the general counsel and it's funny because there's one that always wears a suit a matter of fact he's never seen without his jacket to the suit on buttoned
yeah like that Lionel something or another that black boy of they had a television program about him two hour movie
yeah that would not be fun
yeah didn't know that
and with pro ball you mean
do you i drive a Honda Accord
um i don't i don't care for Wheel Of Fortune very much
that's right and uh so we kind of it's it's we've gone from one extreme to the other and that's that's been hard to adjust to but uh the weather we can't oh the weather's been wonderful
you know and and if it doesn't go through the second time that woman's out thirty bucks
well yeah yeah i do but i still hated to see it  i mean one of the reasons i voted for Bush was because
uh and and you know some people might not believe that but uh but i do
oh it's horrible isn't it
yeah they they're not their prices aren't that terrific they they used to be but they've gotten they've got to pay for all that national advertising now
uh when we were raising a family i think back then we just now we feel like we might could live without one but uh we have a Discover card and i have to laugh about the cash back do you have one of those
oh you can really get some good really good pictures in black and white
they had uh kind of uh i don't know if you call it stand down or whatever but anyway they stopped and wait to see if Iraq would accept a permanent cease fire situation though as i understand it from the Iraqi point of view this current cease fire thing that the UN uh had set up you know the Iraqis are probably not going to go for at all unless they're just absolutely forced to
and the Kurd refugees
yeah as a matter of fact yeah
so do you work with TI
yeah i agree they
so i don't have to fool with any of it no
so what do you think we're going to get
i know it's easy to do especially if you if you have a job where you have to buy nice clothes and things
uh-huh so it's even closer to you
yeah well you never i don't think you ever lose that that that which you which you begin with that accent
hum yeah that's interesting no ours you know wouldn't they were just regular plaster walls
um-hum because you know they don't give you a whole bunch of them pills
well that's how the show that's how the show ended it just left you hanging there like you know like you set me up you fed me all this information information you know that made it look like this other person was guilty you know and
no we went to uh uh uh i we stayed at the Park Park Plaza Park Suites
well do you um meet with clients and so you have to dress a certain way for the clients or
and it's the days that i keep looking for that aren't going to happen in my lifetime
i wouldn't like that well you just can't depend on it
did that help you understand a lot what was going on your your prior experience with the military did
i mean like Kevin Costner did all of his own scenes and uh they had to teach a wolf how to to howl uh-huh that's the part they had trouble finding was wolves
trading their lives for cigarettes
how to combat it i mean i don't i don't think uh ideally you know you need money to do everything so that's one thing that
if they make it so that it's not a horrendous inconvenience i think most people would
yeah on the uh there's there's there's a place for consumer debt and then you take ten percent of it on the
that's what i mean there's a lot of reasons why i don't go to movies and primarily i mean i now i'm probably going to going to upset you but people who bring kids irritates the heck out of me
yes and what's really neat about it is the shrimp is cooked in your uh like your rice steamer your rice cooker
i've read that i got uh i got the interested in when Saddam Hussein came to power i got interested in him and started reading some of his some of the books on him the man's
yeah it's a Walt Walt Disney movie
oh yeah yes uh and then then that gets into a vicious circle
if i had a car uh the a bus
yeah oh yeah that television it gives you everything
so but it's  it's just you know oh well we've been talking for five minutes that's the only obligation we have
left and so we took two kids with us and nobody brings two children in these seats you know because
yes i remember that i had to do some of my husband's papers because i had access to one but you know he his was more for scientific stuff than for word processing you know so
we're very far from our families and it's really hard families little children and um they were the only grandchildren and so our our families are are are really far away in fact this is a little off the topic but yesterday my mother happened to be on a train going from Phoenix to back to Chicago and it stopped in Dallas for a half an hour so
you know you can fly just about as cheap as you can drive so
you you know sausage because i'm from New Orleans originally and um i was gonna make that red beans and rice with the those Cajun sausage and French bread with garlic butter and stuff
you know and wait for him to whenever he decide to pay it  you know
yeah i i i agree i the thing that scares me uh though about where i would i would want definitely want some sort of legislation and coming from the north east i'm just not used to seeing um these and i i know this may sound kind of stereo typical but the cowboys with the gun racks in the back of their trucks
yeah that wasn't a very good thing that happened to that family
that's a fact
let me  i'll hit it again just in case
i think that that they have much i like that they've changed it to lethal injection rather than you know the electric chair or gas
and i guess
i wish i had some to spend
i yeah that's a good idea and and uh other than the work place and here at home um i don't know too much is going on in the community i know that in Plano it's a larger city in the area they they uh i believe about a month or two ago they started having the citizens separate their refuse
uh he had only given up two hits and uh two walks and nine strike outs so he's he's back in the groove and a a guy his age this this afternoon here it's about seventy nine degrees
oh okay um-hum exactly and it seems like everything is raising every everything that can be cigarette not that i smoke but cigarettes
it's that's the way they just brought up well uh where're you from by the way
they kind of went in there and took over
yeah those those are those are always the i i think those are more fun than major league games sometimes
yeah it was it's it's uh seems to have worsened considerably
oh man that makes it tough on the the whole club the management all the way down the rest of the players
and i have just casually asked her what he did for a living and she said oh he's the supervisor of this chemical land fill you know where they go and dump all this toxic stuff
uh-huh yeah do because uh i love to read his his uh children's  books just
right use it as a just a
it doesn't just breakdown one it's not a one to one reaction it's it's a catalytic thing and it it actually just rumbles around and around and and breaks up every C O you know O O O three molecule it hits
right yeah there's a lot of crazies out there that can just go in and buy a gun because they don't really ask a lot of questions when you walk into those stores
you don't even know who to payoff huh
that's right that's honestly right
no um my husband has a grandmother in a nursing home and that has been a real mess to say the least
okay um i don't know about you but where i am we have a like an extremely lax dress policy at work and it varies like everyday i mean from jeans one day to business suits the next
uh-huh well i didn't realize it could vary from state to state or university
my i've done that on occasion at at work and my wife does some uh teaching you know little bitty weekend type teaching for some women in the area and and she likes to work up little outlines and things in this format and so i do all the work for her at work and it would really be nice to be able to do it here and say is this what you want you know instead of going back and forth every day it takes us a little while to get it right but uh i don't know maybe someday we'll uh get around to getting something decent uh
so that's just you know i just i i i just really enjoy it and i hate to here see people gripe and moan about doing uh yard work what about trees do you have any trees around
do you kind of think it's something else then
it it depends on the person on the individual but uh the one factor i think
uh-huh oh definitely definitely i know my stepfather bought my mother a little personal computer oh i guess probably three years ago for Christmas and
so and so now it takes me ten minutes
and are now now that even though California has reinstated the death penalty for whatever various crimes the people who were there originally when they when they changed the laws to revoke the death penalty are still in there for are in prison in quote for life and and are now coming up for parole some of them like Manson who's come up
yeah and you just sit down and all the girls were all dressed up and all this you know i just was there you know like i made it i'm here you know and uh it was just kind of funny because you know but we got to sit by first base if they'd hit a ball i would have been afraid it would have knocked my face in you know
right like where i work it's it's pretty casual um
because i wouldn't want to have to figure this seven point something percent i guess they've got a little table though and it's all written out
well i've kind of resisted having any pets because well i had some pets as a child
they've had longer hunting seasons than that up here even to get rid of more of them because they were uh increasing so much
yeah i've been with them for about four years now
well that's darn easy then
oh  do are you can you put them can you put them right in the water or oh that's good
science medical science has prolonged life but they have they haven't really prolonged the quality of it that that's i think that's really the problem they can bring you back bring bring you out of death but they can't
well that's not of course that's not the total thing but that'd explain a lot of it and then uh i guess the drug thing is really uh become a an engine for crime here lately
um i don't know i you know i heard a very interesting and maybe it's just the TV show or movie i was watching they were going through a trial and i think it was like on one of the the documentary TV shows where they ask for the the verdict by the jury
well i have no objections to it It's just uh and it's a matter of your taste uh
correct that uh i guess the uh the big thing about that is the fact that they're spending someone else's money it's not like it's they're out of their own savings account
that's not that's really good compared to eighteen and twenty one which some of them are uh uh some of them are really extreme high
just to check the validity of the lab yeah and uh so that's kind of an ongoing test process for the we do for Compucam and you know they don't know which ones are test samples
and um having people but you know our like in our church it it is you're free to do that or not you're encouraged to do it because um you know it it helps you and
yeah yeah you would think they would
it was unusual not to have the different sources you know of news coverage
and if you like Chinese food you can take filet of fish and put a little bit of soy sauce and a little bit of sesame oil on top of it
yeah and that you know i have that same uneasy feeling that other folks have you know i know i  i mean i don't drink i don't smoke i don't do nothing
they're they're not helping you uh be able to afford the insurance that they're making you buy
oh okay yeah yeah yeah so do we
which i mean i think it should be anyway
okay talk about it but can't do anything about it uh okay
cook and eat and to have mainly mainly i guess i get the enjoyment out of people eating it and saying man this is really good um
no see i haven't seen that one uh
oh gosh that sounds great uh-huh well um i think it would probably depend on whether this was a formal or informal dinner party but if it was informal my first choice would be crawfish
well it works that way with uh with anybody who buys it's very difficult when you first buy your house uh but once but once you do that and hang on to it you'd be surprised what inflation does to uh
yeah but he's just shooting them and they just killing them off
really jeez yeah you kind of wonder what really happened
golly that's ridiculous
yeah oh they'd have to move it to Taiwan for people not to know about it practically
oh it sure can because uh the you never just you just can never tell what it's going to do
yes yes it is down in uh more southern and and western areas and of course we're um about two hours from the northern border straight south and
i've got the this is the neat thing about the place we ended up at i'm sitting on about a two acre lot now and uh half of it's the back half is my garden
so they can't take it away from you
which is not a bad deal one of the secretaries we have down here is paying twelve percent through GMAC or something
do you uh does does she ever want to go back to Syria
i've my husband's company does a little bit of profit sharing but my company doesn't and i'd really like it if my company did  they turn quite a profit at times but it's not part of uh what's available so
which has a lot of members uh if you can get those types of groups
hi Wanet how are you
yeah what about with adults you think they can do anything about just adult regular adult crime
no mine doesn't either but with specific yeah but with specific cases people but you know the names aren't familiar anymore and
uh-huh i think too that with us as women being out of the home where i'm not working now i didn't work until about from about the time Emily about four months before she was born
yeah um-hum at uh Camp Warnicke
it you know it's it i mean they do generate a lot of soot but that at least you know that kind of particulate comes out of the air pretty quickly
informative and interesting and uh i was real impressed at how ABC handled uh translating the war for children
uh reading about and and i suppose that there is uh justification for taking everybody if you take anybody
have quite good news i think channel eight is the number one uh ABC affiliate in the US i think Tracy Rowlett was saying that he course he pumping his own
that's pretty good yeah my oh my husband won't even put his name on it i don't believe in those
that's exactly right i mean it's nothing um uh it doesn't cover doctors or anything else it's crazy
ah no it's not over crowded it's uh it it far enough away so it's not over crowded and it's surrounded by cliffs so no matter how much wind it is there is always a big portion of the lake that's calm
i took a picture of her  and that was all it all it lasted for
you know they expect you Saturday like on Saturdays Friday you know Saturdays and Sundays and Friday and stuff but not during the week
well how many credit cards do you have
and uh there's only there's two people taking care of about five kids uh where i'm where i'm taking my two
no i don't my my wife has been working with them
no it's a necessity
he's good he's he's talented boy he is
yeah i guess i i guess we're really into spring now
Smiley Burnette i don't know if you're old enough to remember him
and i knew that they had presented an extremely slanted viewpoint
they're okay they're not um out of anything yet they're still hanging in there
because everything that TI did anyway we we shipped in and it was worked on down there assembled and then sent back here so i didn't feel that we really exploiting exploiting them any
oh okay and they're taking the money that they earn to plant trees
and then it funneled down to uh the general population
but i uh sounds like you like one thing that i like like swimming you like that a lot
they're supposed to have all these laws passed where people aren't supposed to hire illegal aliens and all this and whether that's working or not i don't know because i don't hear anymore about it
now that's a thought well that's a thought i hadn't thought about doing that
all right i i didn't catch that for a minute
so yeah a hundred and ten degrees and
is it too in Texas also i i didn't know
well i i still think people have a choice i you know if you can live with it and it's not you know your conscience is clear
it at times gets incredibly hot here
you know and and if it doesn't go through the second time that woman's out thirty bucks
oh yeah that that to me yeah it'd be very hard to believe too
they're they know better  they know better  yeah yeah
yeah i don't care for that at all
and with with the uh people that are coming into the country from other countries not knowing the language and uh they're they're going to the big cities it makes it very difficult
yes and you wouldn't want to have to walk uh you know in high heels it's hard to walk a long way and the campus is pretty large
she's kneading on my my stomach pushing and pushing and drooling
oh yeah we i guess there's Science Place One and Science Place Two we've only been in i think it's Science Place Two
so uh what do you think about our involvement in the Middle East
well they feel invulnerable invulnerable to uh
um-hum i will admit it's interesting i i i'm twenty six so i don't have any more experience in that than you um
uh we have a lot of different things right now we save about twenty five percent of our of our pay
who do they of course you know Mike Marshall was the big guy the year that uh uh they won the World Series and Kirk Gibson Who who are are the Dodgers big RBI guys now
but he's really happy he went there
Reggie Roby who does he play for
and now we're looking at serious i i mean i'm a technician when they start getting rid of technicians
for under two thousand dollars where you know just a few years ago it would have been six seven eight nine thousand dollars
uh no i wasn't
you know when they pull in there's a snake instead of a fish and things like that that i'm just
yeah it was it's pretty warm
we're really enjoying it i wonder what it would be like i mean i i wanted to be close to family but i also thought that it would be harder to be close to family  but it's turned out really good and i think that you know we're really satisfied with that choice and
yeah if you can get by that hurdle
you know and it kind of scares me especially with all the shootings that have been going on in L A on the freeways and then you come here in in the Dallas area um
i didn't know it made the national news
well you too all alrighty good-bye
yeah it's it's actually turning out to be more more useful than what i thought and um i also have a good languages background linguistics
you know so many so many of these jokers get the death penalty and then you know just end up in prison uh
yeah can't put them down
was that all i have to do it you know  there's got to be something else i have to do and i'm no it's just really easy and setting up your own cost your own uh work groups now too where as we had to do it before
did um-hum um did you have another a big tent like uh um for like a looks like a sitting area type you know like a two room type tent
well i hope so
i can see having kids and not letting them watch TV and making them toys out of wood
just about oh it really is it really is also i said we mostly did ours before we started a family
she started some type of um  national um organization for youth to volunteer to teach tutor other kids to read and you know do different service projects like that and trying to get youth more directed towards
that after all they're only people too in that they're subject to corruption just like any other human being and they do have a lot of power
she and she had drank all her iced tea and she
yep exactly i like things that uh you know two people can do but i like the quiet of doing things away you know kind of gives you some space for yourself and that's what i find in making the dolls and things that it gives me something that i can create and i like to crochet and knit i made some afghans and that kind of stuff i like doing things with my hands
they always think they can win you know which is the way it should be and boy he never gave up i'll tell you
i think what they're trying to say is that there is a great deal of historical truth but the interpretation that actually got into the um the writing of the Bible itself is probably uh after the what uh was it the King James Version when the committee
yeah this house that i have is just a three bedroom ranch and i can tell you there's nothing around it cement foundation all the way round it not a shrub not a bush
uh is ridiculous for people just taken off the street to understand and really should have some better way where people who understand both the circumstances and the complex issues involved
yeah was the only thing about the costuming my husband remarked that it didn't that that um the Indians all appeared to be wearing new things
uh you know being uh i mean by the time you get off work go by and pick up the uh baby from the baby sitter it's you know after six and by the time everything is settled in it's ten o'clock before i can catch up on anything
i don't know we have a seven year old it's pretty funny like stay out
did you read are you do you interested in stuff like that or
i bet you are i bet you are i don't know you know when i was in uh when i was in high school several years ago you know we did probably two or two or three weeks on the subject you know and tried to teach you the whole thing in two or three weeks and of course when you're that age you really don't care anyway and i didn't get into it very much but then i took a a list of a basic math class a couple of semesters ago and we uh we were pretty heavily into the metric system and and before we started i just thought oh no i don't want to do this you know this is just going to be so hard and once i really realized how easy it was
oh yeah that did it to New England a couple years ago didn't it
well that will be neat
well uh i guess it's one of those things that uh if it's going to really promote a lasting peace if there is not going to be a peace
how does she get to work
prior to that i was told that she was dead and um apparently what had happened was that i had a grandfather who um put her into a mental institution
i i don't either it's a really delicate uh moral issue because if if you have well i guess the one thing i do see that is is that needs to be a solution is that if you do let people into the country i do feel you have a certain obligation
that was a that was a real good one
sounds like it
right but see i really think yeah i i think those characters came right off the screen in that story you know it was really enjoyable and and my wife we thought the same thing we were so pleasantly surprised
yeah not uh just just enough to get by
yep oh yeah they do they get real emotional about it all the i've worked with a lot of people that hunt and they just they they don't see any sense in it at all they think it's ridiculous to have any kind of gun control but then of course they're hunters they know what they're doing they don't realize there're a bunch of crazy people out there that
because there is so much smoke in the air yeah areas the smoking area you know it's closed in and if you don't if you don't smoke and you go in there that everybody that goes in there smokes so it's full of smoke when when you go in there
and of course the people end up paying for it are the fans
Creedance Clearwater Revival uh Crosby Stills Nash and Young when it was still all four
so it's been uh it's been almost a year i guess since i've actually uh swung a club for a purpose
you know and if you're taking medication from a doctor that's no big deal either
everybody likes his speed but he can't catch the ball
that was that was pretty good um and
so i got an opportunity to transfer back and i took it
so well have a good day and i appreciate the conversation
so they put they they want you know they want the best and they don't think they think what the best is is reputation for for research and that's a one standard but it's not relevant to what they need
hum yep the more cars the merrier the paperwork
so she works with in in in sales so a good portion of her you know her salary is is quarterly bonuses
no i can't either  i really can't um
okay i guess you don't enjoy that very much
yeah yeah i mean uh yeah well as far as that goes yeah i mean you wouldn't like to see anybody anything happen to anybody but it was just how she got so caught up her emotions
wow wow yeah now i never knew they were that that big huh
in fact nobody going to beat us then because look how good we did without a quarterback this year
uh well it's interesting they do uh well they do and they don't not like we do here you can't buy it off the street corners but there's so much money to be made in drugs
it's a it's a tough question it really is i guess if i had to say you know yes or no i would say you know yes i i would have to lean toward capital punishment you know for certain crimes
but see they'll come in and do work that other people won't do now i don't know about this day and time when there's so many people out of work i know if i was out of work i'd do anything to make money
yeah yeah we don't either
bronze oh interesting
and are we still going to maintain drams for perfume
and our answer was that you know we will have enough money available for him to attend a state college and if he wants to go to a private college he can get a scholarship to attend you know and that was kind of our view on it it just costs too much you just can't do it you know so i don't know it's it's i don't uh it just amazing it amazes me how much the the costs are going to go up over the next ten or fifteen years i just don't know how anybody's going to do it
uh right yeah uh got to counting the other day and uh i think i have what was it two hundred and i got to thinking the money that i've got invested in this
i forget the the other one the he-man or something like this and um and i i i found it uh to be very good The atmosphere was good it was a lot of fun
but yes but still it came up though didn't it i mean you know
job and home and family and all sorts of other possibilities you know they may be going to school or may have elderly parents or you know all sorts of other things
um-hum i know but what's yours do you agree or do you disagree or i mean what do you think long term
i have been told that thing is just lovely
oh he just like totally sarcastic and hilarious and i don't know i'm a lot like him in a way so
right yes that's true well sure have enjoyed our talk
oh that was a great one
i think that that's a good benefit i think having women uh in in higher up positions stuff like that
you know but i've seen one of those and it's not that great i mean because they really
so it's not a it's not a thick rich type of a sauce it's more of a when you use corn starch in in gravy like you know when you have um Chinese food
i had one of those too it was a weather phone call yeah
and which isn't alway always the case in all cultures and it wasn't until i was thinking about it just now that i realized that's actually something that's culturally relative
terrible you get those uh Chinook winds coming across the prairies and golly it's uh it's unbelievable the extremes in weather up there but i enjoy it gosh i
the only thing that frightens me about that is the Graylord cases in uh Chicago where so many judges were guilty of so much misjustice from the bench
yeah well they have some you know half way decent rapids there
i kind of wonder you know gosh if i could sit on the bench and earn five hundred thousand dollars a year i'd just be happy to sit there
yeah that's a problem with capital punishment though but when you got people that you know uh for some reason or another Charles Manson sticks in my brain
yes i know many people have said well if you throw everyone out and start over but then you uh the the amount of them who would be on lifetime income is so stupendous there's they have locked their benefits in to the point that once they've served two terms they're on gravy train anyway yes i think you're right i don't think we should ever give them a lifetime thing
population and the originator of our English system of measure uh they have gone metric
so what kind of cooking do you do up there
yeah yeah i wasn't talking about just Mexico i was talking about Europeans the Eastern Block uh it's terrible
the other school systems that aren't as good um i don't know any particular ones but you know when  when they say one of the where i went to school was one of the best counties then i think
yeah yeah obviously human life means nothing to him
they're on weekdays at eleven o'clock everyday Monday through Friday
things cropped up you know so we decided to put ourselves on a cash budget well the first time we did it we just took some arbitrary amount that we estimated it would be and then we kept track of everything for a month
but i right but i agree it has to be at their choice and it needs to be a time when they're ready to do it um i don't think you can just snatch somebody away from you know you don't know what their circumstances are or what's going on in their life you can't just snatch them away and make them go do something they don't want to do
i don't keep up with it that often
we're having sleet and rain in Indiana this morning so
yeah oh yeah that was just such super team
yeah so what's the latest one you've read
that's right and his old day care as much as i loved it you know and the owner i really liked her and she worked really hard to get good people but the people that she got
well the other side i see because we have Mexico as a neighbor
it's it's difficult
right i i think that i i mean i wouldn't be so upset about the amount of taxes paid if it weren't for the fact that they don't they don't go to any place you know you you don't see it going to any place where it belongs
well they have one in uh they have an Argentinean place down in Georgetown
or give away as gifts
yeah i'm i'm we're not from Texas we're from further we're from Missouri so it's it's
oh yeah well you have to see them more than that i i i still catch things in Airplane that i didn't catch
yeah yeah we do it uh it sometimes works and it sometimes doesn't it's i uh when i start doing trim i i've gotten to where i i tend to freehand it because there there's so many layers of paint on this house after forty years that uh it it's so hard to tell where an edge is anymore and uh
this is that's the only fallback i see because i've seen like when the Vietnamese come over they get they have stores and you know Uncle Sam done bought uh uh you know Uncle Sam had to pay for it they gave them that loan but people over here can't even get a small business loan like that
you know on the schedule but then it seems like it might be longer than a week
got to have the cranberry sauce yeah
oh me i'm in favor of it
yeah well my wife we have a new one in the house and she's she's stays home too also
you wouldn't be able to steer people toward retirement and all that but boy if you save that much money and it didn't have the taxation problem well you might might do all right i don't know it seems
and sometimes you'll get it on the first try i mean it's just
and he thought that turned out pretty good because it you know it helped him to understand and be functional now and it helped him to have a close relationship so that's one one way he looked at it
and i even lubricate the car myself because i have a i have means of of running it up on on jack stands and and you know i have a creeper and i crawl around underneath it so it's not a big deal
that's about it as far as exercise
oh yeah uh-huh and and they'll keep going until they get that out of you when your wife is going to be here because they want us to be here together because i guess uh it's it's
yeah actually my house is Kosher but um it turns out that one one of the strangest things about about Israel is that no um most folks don't realize that but all the food that people think of as sort of you know Jewish food and so forth um
uh i did see Red October
it's hard to say i'm sort of a very big Twin Peaks fan and beyond that i just sort of watch anything that happens to be on i'm i'm half the time i'm a TV addict and the other half the time i just ignore it it's really bad yeah there's some new shows that i sort of like um have you seen this Shannon Steel Show or uh it's about a lawyer it's one of these lawyer shows you know they they seem to be popular these days and then there's just a lot of those sort of Blair shows floating around
i have no idea who listens to this
hi how you doing
they're not going to do it that's my biggest problem is even if you give them the death penalty they appeal it and appeal it and appeal it and there's you know
so you can kind of go in there and just bring your sleeping bag
yeah yeah it's a it's a beautiful city
most people do or they have to anyway
uh in Wyoming it would be less spicy
yes i do she was um at a private well i stayed off work with her for little over for of a year when she was born and then i
yeah i think i've seen you know commercials yeah
well March is the the month for high winds
yeah yeah we generate one of our our biggest electrical plants in Rhode Island uses coal to uh generate electricity um
um-hum yeah well it's so neat because it's right there and i can go just right after work and you know before i get home because once i get home that that tends to be it so
well it's been interesting to talk to you
for me any time i needed extra help any time of the day
and if you do that this is going to be the consequence but it you couldn't do that even through the state even the mother it wasn't through the state but even though um the mother really would given approval but because of the situation we just didn't think it was wisdom you know you go in a restaurant and they start spitting their food out at the table now come on but you know you couldn't do really a lot because of the state's control so that's that's a good idea there too i like that but
yeah i'm trying to think what i've seen lately i mean well well we just finished watching uh Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles on tape you know
match just right and the only bad news was my husband would have to go to a garage and pick them up pick the bolts up for him
eight of which survived and uh and she we ended up keeping one of those puppies
i can't think of what his name is right right off the bat though but uh they they they were fun they were real just books for fun
and the lyrics aren't as uh inspiring  if you want to call it that
exactly absolutely that's the part that i really think we need to change
no huh-uh yeah somebody in South Carolina told me about him
some of them disagree i mean some of them said one way and some the other
they're like a a water bug of sorts i don't know what they're called them yeah yeah yeah when when you touch them they roll up
yeah i'd i'd like to go camping cross country um i just got married less than two years ago so we don't have any any children yet um
sure an anybody that's got that much military might is going to be a threat
well see i'm not either because i'm i'm really not for higher taxes you know to go out and pay for uh more people to be out on the street as far as the officers and things like that but uh
sulked for a while huh  well i like animals but we don't have any yet we have a nine month old with another on the way and we thought well maybe when they're a little bit bigger then we'll or get into a house with a little more space
so i don't i don't even know who your favorite team is actually
it sure is and i think here at TI we get what is it nine or ten
yeah yeah we do it uh it sometimes works and it sometimes doesn't it's i uh when i start doing trim i i've gotten to where i i tend to freehand it because there there's so many layers of paint on this house after forty years that uh it it's so hard to tell where an edge is anymore and uh
and it's it's really nice to go and see them you know where they can still get around and everything and they still you know do their own thing but it's it's really nice to see them because i mean sometimes like i had a great aunt she lived with us for um three months and because she's starting to get Alzheimer's disease
so maybe you would
i think the the most important thing for me right now is is really the medical coverage
um-hum they slipped that in on us when we're not looking
very performance power i mean they're there is yeah big time
i like mysteries
and uh a um a nineteen eleven which is fairly scarce i found several good ones out of there
oh i love that that's neat that's neat well i used to go camping all the time as a a Girl Scout
and just because they had had a couple of bad seasons and you can't even attribute those bad seasons to bad coaching
yeah i think so i i don't really think we need to know or even sometimes care so much about all the little nitty-gritty things they keep asking over and over i think think the reporters sometimes ask the silliest questions
uh-huh um-hum was it very crowded out there or
a couple of Russians walk in and look at it and say well we have the worst of both worlds communism and capitalism
i think uh basically what we're going to have to do is now that Bush has made the made the stand is what we'll have to continue to uh stick up for our foreign policy if we don't then what's going to happen is that everybody well it's just a one time shot they're not going to do anything
i you know i was going into the grocery store and a  a lightning bolt was almost directly overhead and it was twenty six degrees out
aren't you kitty cat
i noticed in uh an article in the paper where i didn't read the whole article but you know the headlines anyway indicated that there's a a seems to be a consensus among small and medium size business owners that the uh the output of the American worker is on the decline you know pretty severely but uh
uh-huh that's one thing i like about the Spring Creek place at least the fellow that's there one of the fellows that's there at night and on weekends is real helpful
i think it does have to be unanimous
to represent you and so i really don't i don't agree that you have too many choices that you know it's it's too hard and i think that people are just lazy i think they don't want to get out
i have a hard time inventing shots you know let's go around this tree and you know try a slice through a hook here and i can't do that so i i finally got out and i've been watching quite a few videos i
they bought the place but um i knew that they would you know if i left like one bulb of each one of them by this year they'd have ten bulbs of each one of them
and still have it producing and okra okra will grow real okra will grow to be six foot tall it's just
yeah that's that's it we'd like to be closer to family but limits the job your welcome Brittany
yeah but at the same time i don't know it's pretty far to throw that far  i couldn't do it
let's get grass so that the kids can play in the yard and not have to be worried about the dirt so much you know
i mean you know there's all kinds of drawbacks much less the drug testing
um i don't know him
and then again it it depends depends on the the bigger you are and you know the more bulk that you have you you can your system can tolerate more alcohol so a large person can probably um metabolize maybe a little bit more
and he said a what and i said a tire tool he said you mean a T A R tool and i said no a T I R E tool
and uh it's just it it's got to start at home is where it's got to start and
so i didn't learn much growing up and i just after i we bought the cars you know and things got so expensive to take them someplace all the time
and yep but they had nothing to back it up and
you know and they wrote down that they uh weren't but then they went back and they checked them like maybe a week after they were working and if they had drugs in their body i mean they were fired on the spot there was no ifs ands or buts about it
when our children were all three at home our oldest daughter uh is still a very giving caring wonderful person she's making a career of uh well she's a director at a care center close to here in fact my mother's a resident there anyhow was uh she got us involved in the Christian Children's Fund and we were sponsoring a young boy in Chattanooga Tennessee in a home then and that went on for oh four or five years and finally we had a letter from the Christian Children's Fund that they were no longer going to uh sponsor children within the continental United States that all of the money would be going to children overseas because for however much money we were sending a month they could buy so much more milk and bread and rice and so on and so forth for children overseas well at
uh to do that i don't know i'd have to be i don't know
and i knew the people involved both the people who perjured and the people who uh were defendants
well you i don't know no i can't no and they probably used to have it i just finished a a major research paper a couple of weeks ago and i couldn't imagine not having that thing on a disk where i could go back in and move stuff around and change it i
yes there's too many people
because they gave my husband some when his mother passed but that was for like to calm him down
yeah yeah i've got a weight bench and we got my wife an exercise bike and i use that sometimes too
yeah how much how well they're doing yeah we do i um i i work in a uh speech interface lab at a at a at a college
i can agree with that and uh i know one thing we we need to do a lot of spending cuts instead a lot of raising taxes because that's what's really  hurting everybody's goat
had an enormous jump in the uh in the SAT rate
yeah isn't that ridiculous
it's not anything that seems to be um you know costing everybody a lot of money it's not a major topic of conversation it's just something that's done and accepted
um-hum oh they do have some absolutely gorgeous things so uh but they uh the one we just watched that we had videotaped from the weekend was the Gardens of the World did you see that one this week
i get to see just about everything
my dad had one he had a Dodge
yeah well this part of the country there's no shortage shortage of uh good schools
then i won't tell you
in biographies well i uh i have read some biographies i prefer to read if i read a biography it's mostly because maybe i have to uh you know back when i was in school i had to have information about that person or um preparing some kind of lesson and i need to have
but now as far as what they can do about it i don't know
yes we always had to big concern about hurricanes because we're close enough to the coast and you know you had to have a supply like uh emergency supply on hand all the time during the hurricane season and
they have to have a college fund  so
so now she finds the basement sales and just like you know everybody else
they have got two log cabin shelters that are basically uh four walls and a roof log cabins with a concrete floor and a picnic table in them and a ceiling fan and screened uh windows
i have a have an idea of what i wanna do i don't really know how to get started so i i look at something get me get me ah yeah well i'll add this to it and do this and turns out pretty good sometimes
i think alcohol's a a whole lot worse drug and it's more widely accepted
and uh of course flying uh using your Social Security number of course permits people to do that
um-hum yeah well uh get back to compooter computer programming of yours uh
oh it's really it's true
um did you ever get to watch any of the uh New Orleans games
you know even uh i think even in the the story where they had to pay the taxes the disciples and uh Jesus said the money in the fish's mouth or in the fish's inside the fish
is it good education it may be free but is it good education and that's just it are we willing to pay for it you know
um-hum oh that's good any other problems
and uh along with all the other uh uh plants i've got in the house a lot of different types
oh God oh man this is too scary that is just too scary you know i let Brian play here in the back yard and we've got
and the question is who are my sheep and the idea do we go out and feed these people when they're hungry
uh-huh that is terrible and the other person has to hear it
and and they will take the time allotted to make their choices to do that
well i don't know how you feel about this but uh it's really scary to me
carry all that cash with you
uh we i i look at our home though and i think well gosh you know if we don't do this then the next person who owns this home for instance is going to probably remodel the kitchen put in new cabinets that kind of thing you know after oh twenty six years uh things get a little scuffed up and it's not something that i'm not interested in the mess anymore
they they'll serve they'll serve a quarter of it so if you want them to stay in prison for fifteen years don't sentence them to fifteen years sentence them to a hundred you know because then they'll serve fifteen or twenty so which is really i don't know
get out there on your hands and knees and crawl around
and i think that's but i think uh after after we um after i finish school and we're ready to you know settle down someplace and i get a decent job then we'll look for something probably with a nice size yard that we can have a garden
yeah that's not bad
oh i never heard of it
yeah well what kind of things do you normally have with it people have different ideas of what goes with it
here goes Sharon
for a while i was doing it every day just
yeah i mean they've been they've been young for a while and they're almost almost starting to age a little bit here i just um yeah they they're they're really hurting pitching wise i mean they've got Ryan but you know who knows
it is good but it it looks i mean what you can do then see is like what i usually do is i'll like sit the cauliflower in the middle and then i put the uh shrimp around the outside of it you know on my platter
part of me says that i'd kind of like to do it just to see what it's like to be in that position where you are playing you know life and death with somebody else could i bring myself to do it
i i liked Atlanta too i have a sister-in-law that lives in Atlanta
would too we usually uh like i said we try to go to a lake my husband and this uh other couple that we go with her husband um they like to um is it scuba dive and so we'll go to a lake and uh where they can go do that we're close enough so they can do that and the girls can play on the beach area okay
there's there's like twelve or fifteen feet on one side but on the other side there's over sixty feet before the next house because they they set us back a little ways and they turned it sideways so our houses begin to to turn to to make this turn as it were so we're real far away and we have a really large lot we have a bigger lot than all the rest of the the ones down the street but uh as it turned out we decided we learned that neither one of us really likes taking care of all that grass so it it was a bit of a drawback but uh it'll probably make for a good selling point if we ever give it to someone that does like all that grass
uh well plan on it at least
loves that's right loves the little dog loves to travel of course she's dead asleep before we get to the end of the block and she never you know she sleeps the whole time but she loves to travel
uh so that's all in self improvement to stay focused on who the customer is and as you probably well know all of us are our own customer your my customer i'm your customer sort of thing um
well i have i'm really torn on the subject i'm not a good candidate for this one i see what you see and i agree with you
well i took piano lessons in fourth grade once for one semester i'll never forget Mrs Burkhalter
i i kind of don't eat Italian food if unless i go home because my mom cooks Italian food and it's like you know the you know she i i think that she cooks the best so there's no reason for me to go out and pay enormous sum for something that's just not as good
and of course you've got the drugs and the uh other problems that you were much more prevalent than when i was going to school
uh no uh no no i do have a place that's rusting i need to get something on it
and so they go you know who who who what does it matter who i vote for
how about you guys are you in a house apartment or a house
anyway it had a lot of things like that thing to make you keep watching just for the novelty and the surprise of it
uh-huh very much When we moved here to Monterrey it was a big change because it's such a small community we're just above Carmel and um there's hardly most everybody seems pretty well employed around here and um those that aren't there's Celinas which is about a fifteen minute drive which is mostly migrant workers and there's a lot of crime there um migrant Hispanic farm workers people that are down and out and uh they all seem to congregate in Celinas not so much here in Monterrey so it's it's pretty quiet you know we walk the streets at night and uh people run in the park and you know you're just have your normal smarts about you then you really don't have to worry or
if if we're talking marijuana if it's in the system uh then
um did someone just come up with this design and and you're going to make one for yourself or are you going to buy it
spend a lot of time on the house and out in the yard and things but um i like to keep up to date too um i guess
yeah i built three houses in my life and
and they keep taking more money from us yeah people and get and they don't have any incentive to work if we're just gonna take fifty percent of it
i guess that's most of my um financial plans right now is is there anything you'd like to add
right you don't work in an area where there's chemicals or machinery or or things like that but
and my and my only hope is that um whatever kids we have want to go to school wherever i teach
come by uh on your regular garbage day and pick up the recycling out at the curb
you say you retired a year ago
okay uh i use them both here at work and at home
but it's the only uh well it's part of the bank holding company and that bank holding company of the ten largest banking holding companies in Texas it's the only one that's still alive
but i just don't i think we're and then they keep raising the taxes boy i'll tell you what i barely make ends meet and they raise taxes and
yeah but now um now that it's happening i i feel comfortable with it i i don't feel as though i've lost anything and that i feel uh secure in that i know that everybody that works around me um is is drug free
yeah what company is it
that sounds right i would i'd take him up on that
oh wow i haven't seen those
no yeah and i also spent uh eight years with TI out in uh Ridgecrest California
we have been known to do that in the past we've we've got a couple of wild cats out there in our general vicinity and you know they're they're tame enough that they come up and want you to feed them but they're not tame enough that they want to stay around or come in or anything so you know those are just Big Cat and Little Cat
i'm in an apartment in uh Plano
i i would be impressed i mean you know
you know like a year old it was ridiculous and she's got two day cares within like three blocks of each other yes so its i mean she's
and killed all them people what's uh Saddam did
okay so i guess we have nothing to do on the other end there's no uh interruptions here to tell us that we're done or
so that's uh because he has a pretty strong will and he directs his own way so it should be you know pretty good
it could be real dangerous
yeah  a satellite dish
by an agent who represented i'm not sure of the companies he represented but i was told because you're single they absolutely won't take you i said that is that's prejudicial that's terrible what's going to happen if they all start doing this
talk about Pittsburgh yeah your right it's like i mean this is very strange because i'm not in that part of the country i don't care if they listen i'm not in that part of the country  i don't want to offend you i and i'm not in their part of the country so what i hear all my best friends are in western Pennsylvania and it's like oh
me too yeah that's interesting
well uh i don't have a lot of time to watch TV unfortunately this is not a good subject um i
sounds like it
oh you ought to try some crawfish they are good but see that's one good thing about living down here is usually anybody that comes over you know even if it's like out of town guests and stuff they want our cooking
uh they get to the other end of their career and now they come up and talk to you between innings of games i i think that was exciting too uh have you seen any minor leaguers come through uh any guys come through Raleigh that are now in the big time
due to the overabundance of news we have available to us
you know we've got um well like i say i know that there are some type of programs that they have available for a youth like teenagers to go and do um work in the national parks and work in uh neighborhoods to do um clean up and that sort of thing but i don't know what organization it's under i don't know if it's a government run or if it's a private
it may be my phone um anyway it's the only car that says you know sporty and class uh so
and i was thinking well do i really want her to go back with such a jerk
and they get into it and they're over their heads i think that's why there's so many divorces too
well sure that but that's a that's an impossibility i think
well i'm i guess i don't have such such close experience with with um an area becoming a state as you do um my concern is the economy because as i understand it Puerto Rico has a very low standard uh standard of living or at least um annual average income um part of this i suppose is justified in in in that the climate they don't need perhaps the heating and the housing that some of the the more northern territories need however in that case i guess i would favor status quo i have been to Puerto Rico and and found it very very interesting i did Peace Corps training there
um each side has three bedrooms and two baths living room and then a big uh kitchen that has uh dining area in it
you know that that they're not in the home by choice anymore
yeah just as quickly
well i think that's good because you do have to use your mind and imagine up the circumstances and things it's not like
yes we uh uh i haven't missed a one since i've been eligible to vote
you have different telephone numbers that you can dial and then you dial in an access code and it will depending on what topic you called in to hear about whether it was the news or the weather or a soap opera update it will give you um updated information so it can give you you know current news updates current weather updates things like that and it's it's offered through the local phone company free of charge
yeah but well they vary from from place to place it's hard to tell you know how well they've been kept up how old they are and these are probably oh one of the nicest that i found and uh
you know we enjoy that kind of stuff i can't it's hard to believe that nobody can be any more creative than that that can't be the problem it must be the marketing pressures and
oh what which one is that
i think that that if it's if it's not a split decision uh go with the highest number and let's just get on with the program
what he'll be able to do he's been last year he started having some nagging injuries and
i don't either it's interesting though i never heard of such a project before
yeah i change the oil and i do the lubrication
it's it's some sort of government program i've heard a lot of people say good things about it but i just don't know the details on it
yeah but it's it's power power but you have to push it i've uh i've got to admit that the last two lawn mowers that i've gotten um were uh power driven
in a year
yeah and it if you don't have i don't i it's my feeling that if you don't have a role model to follow then it's kind of tough you know everybody's not Father Knows Best
as long as you want to and just you know a reasonable lengthy conversation now uh do you work for Texas Instruments uh
uh where are you Mary Ann
yeah yeah well you know ankle deep or standing on the bank and slipping it out there
and uh Super uh what is it uh uh Bloopers and Super Practical Jokes
yeah i no i think it would be better if they would stay down there and get right papers to come across the border
because we're payin g for Social Security they using now who's gonna pay for mine
i don't i'm not sure that they do i think uh what they're talking about like is uh credit cards and other junk and loan car loans things like that
well i i assume that you live in do you live in Texas
uh you know it's it's sitting there on the dock and you go a hour and nothing's happened he says no dad i know they're down there let's not go i know they're down there and they're and they're gonna bite anytime and uh
yeah yeah i i uh i really i'm bewildered as far as how they could even work something like this in if they try to make it mandatory
oh okay okay like a Kathy Smith workout or Jane Fonda
i've got better things to do with my life
so so that one was all right and then what else i had i think i had some other uh like staying in shape or working out this other guy i got this guy from New York so
president someday maybe
well it's basically you know it's like i got like a leather jacket or a you know so i just put on a T-shirt and a leather jacket and i usually stay in class that way and if not i would wear a sweatshirt underneath it and then you know you'd but what happens is uh what i've seen here on campus it's very strange because a lot of black people here they wear like dress pants and dress shirts to go everywhere
yeah it's kind of like in Louisiana where that uh guy that's like a Ku Klux Klan member something got elected  kind of scary when you think about that
yeah i'd seen the storm you were talking about when it hit um up around the Chicago area uh they had a little film clip about how bad it was up there and i just could not believe how much ice that thing was carrying with it
yeah i i didn't i didn't even like the previews on that
oh my wife and i we had it when we drove through France we paid in tolls to go to Spain and we drove from Germany like the southern southwestern most part of Germany we drove on the tolls and we spent forty six dollars in tolls one way oh and it was like uh it was
so under the circumstances
getting down together and doing that and and just the children were involved in the decision because it involved just them and you know making that decision and then
no the the only people i know that have done anything remotely like that are people that have gone to be missionaries and that's only because i went to Baylor and a lot of students from Baylor go and and serve as missionaries during the summer but i think i think that's a terrible idea that's like forcing someone to donate to a charity
oh i like to read too what kind of books do you like
well i think we've done it  thank you very much it's been interesting
right now we're in the thirties
uh-huh probably things that that there happen every day and we don't even notice them until someone videotapes them
so i sent them a letter with a copy of the canceled check and their card cut up into about a hundred pieces i said here is your card here is the copy of my canceled check never send me anything else and never heard from them
so you know they i i know that's bad but you know the just like Texas now
well of course this is tornado season uh in to uh we have many tornadoes spawned in this area and northern Indiana now we're in the southwestern part of uh Ohio
that's that's uh that's real good we had uh we had organizations like that in college you know we had a community service group in college that had all sorts of different groups and some did like that some did elderly visits some did um
roof of your head's blown off
yeah he was a real wild one
can imagine you have a good you have you could have a good uh choice of cars but then of course there's more people interested in them too
uh i have one recipe for uh a really good um type of a meatball it's called burgundy meatballs and it's made with red red wine and um it's it's really good and you can make it ahead of time and then um make the sauce when you're ready to um to serve it that's one of my favorite things to to serve
and they put the baby on a heart lung monitor when i took her home and the insurance carrier was not going to cover this because it was considered preventative treatment sure
my um husband's father has a place out in East Texas so he's always digging up little red oaks and things like that and trying to bring them back and start them but
right right you've kind of gotten out of that little stage there
t here's also a moral aspect to it a lot of people have not either mentally sat down and gone over the moral aspect can i take human life even in a life threatening situation to myself or to a loved one
unfortunately Yeltsin's got too many connections with the old guard that's the only drawback that i see with the entire thing Gorbachev has m ade his attempt and he's had his problems with some of the old guard himself
oh i'm in my paperwork here that's what i do when i wait for a phone call i get in my paperwork
i think i think the regular schedule stuff um that when you say everybody get out of it that's a good point i never really thought of it that way
he's a the movie critic um oh you've oh okay he's a movie critic on channel eight in Dallas
yeah i guess so but as far as the weight bearing
i'd encourage it
do you ever go see the Rangers
well that's that's good to know how
say he was videotaping this thing you know there she is caught in the dishwasher you know oh it was hysterical and
and when they do that they begin paying interest right from that very day on
in the state or the country
just about everybody i've talked to has been with TI i guess that's i guess that's the same with your husband
no we don't have mandatory we actually we're kind of slow up here and we've just started doing recycling probably last summer and it's all voluntary so that's interesting cities have a mandatory recycling
but um they do that and then we use uh different chemicals and things and i know that you know they're real concerned about how they take care of that sort of thing i i don't know all the details but they're really on top of that
okay uh well there are shops around here that have uh items like that uh not too many with the style that he uses though so
that's why they say always say it's like five degrees warmer in the city at night time than out in the country
well it will be interesting seeing these games across the you know from London or wherever
yeah when i lived in California they had uh what i describe as boring weather it was the same virtually year-round which what i thought was great you didn't have to worry about tornadoes you didn't have to worry about uh too cold or too hot it was just nice and even and i liked that it was it was nice
yeah and just not pay any attention to it yeah
i've never seen it what is it is it like a version of the dating game or huh
what what with ink oh okay
uh thing but uh when i'm exercising regularly i i feel the need to to do more exercise
um-hum yeah i just about could really because i think my car if i continue taking good care of it it's going to hold a pretty good resale value and uh that if i consider going the used car route and save up some money i shouldn't have too much trouble at all
all year right
well it's good to get out and smell some fresh air too
i know there's i don't really know any other recycling that they do
but i don't think so i i have a feeling that's more reflective of our government and everything then
well it's just a huge file that tries to describe the requirements of what you're trying to build
uh when i can i'm a i'm a musician and uh the band i play in uh i this is just something on the side and uh the band i play in we tend to rehearse quite a bit on Sundays so i missed a lot of Sundays during
go out and do the entire yard and you i mean you don't have to put clumps of it just very lightly cover the entire yard
i'm going to build a little house behind yours and then and i'll take care of your lawn he says but i'm not going to one of those places right yeah
i i have seen things i really like you know that were done
yeah so i've just been all over the country and uh some places had really cold weather when i was living in Indiana it got really cold
yeah that's neat oh that's neat yeah
well it's hard to say i mean while it's certainly the case that things like automobiles and factories uh pollute a lot um if you look at how much pollution is say kicked up by an active volcano uh it's certainly less than clear that anything man can do in this sort of scale of things has much effect at all what do you think
and um i also had the supervision that i needed while i was growing up and i hope that i can provide that for my child too
right there's a lot of people like you're educated i'm educated my husband is but i mean a lot of people are flat not educated and if i have a hard time you know putting that into my life can we put that off on the other eighty percent of the population that doesn't have any college or i don't know how much of the you know but a large percentage probably over half of the rest of the population
i did at first but um not really no not i i can't imagine eating meat um the reason i tranged uh changed to become a vegetarian was for ethical reasons so the idea of me eating meet would be like eating something you know i i think of it as something alive you know so it i can't do it you know for for me it's it just
isn't it a little late in the season for that type of ice storm though
wow um-hum um-hum wow it's true it's true just just picking up the equipment that i have you know and and and i didn't blink an eyelash that's what got to me when the man you know said and that'll be five hundred and something dollars you know with my my big new lawn mower and stuff i was just okay you know so yeah you're right you're right you can i think you can go through quite a bit of money i think it depends too where you buy it from if you buy it from a nursery or um we have like Home Depot here i don't know if you have that there is
well but they don't have if you know if i had to put myself in their shoes i have to do it one hundred percent
not that hard i really i really enjoy it
yeah no we we were only there for two years
as little as possible  i'm a college student
um-hum and they're preoccupied with drinking
no something happens then what
no no i think i think he'd rather commit suicide than turn himself in because there's i mean there's like it's like there's no hope you know like what Hitler did you know like if you were going to put on trial you get to live the rest of your life but where
that's interesting i i wonder i don't know if he's he he seems the thing about Gorbachev strikes me that he wouldn't be that dumb  i don't know though
the bigger and heavier the lawn mower the more macho the guy behind it so you know of course he wouldn't couldn't buy one of those little little tiny skinny ones that you can get at one of the uh one of the Aames or
and if you like Chinese food you can take filet of fish and put a little bit of soy sauce and a little bit of sesame oil on top of it
no she didn't even she did not even take the sack this is the laziest dog that ever lived
you know i'm going back to school my wife's going back to school too our lifestyle right now is meant to position ourselves so financial the these financial problems won't be problems uh in the future and uh so
so my immediate reaction was one of that sense of invasion but after that i realized no i i really wanted this and it was sort of exciting and so that was almost an example of a situation an invasion that turns out to be not invasive
yeah uh-huh uh clothes are getting so expensive now in in the stores and the the quality is is sometimes so poor that uh it it really is worth while to sew
wonder because football
no it's good and you've got a lot of federal money too
well i only know i have my friends who have had children uh i only know one woman who's decided to go the quote unquote traditional route and i have a lot of respect for her because she made it as a real choice
so i started taking computer science courses and uh that become my major course of study uh i finished a major in mathematics also i had a double major but uh computer science is what got me a job
thirty something
the um uh you know there are so many ramifications to this entire thing of woman how women have changed uh look at them in England
uh just locally or or what i assume that's what they would do
yeah well um i think the weather lately has been um a bit warmer than i would expect this time of year
yeah there are there's uh big military constituency
to just to see all these things that you can can see on television now and can read about that ten years ago we didn't have this kind of information i mean we didn't know
that's  that's probably why it does i work for GTE
lot of mud
i think they will as long as they can but the problem obviously is the cost of health care as you know it's just going completely out of sight
uh i didn't know that
if if you know if he he does do something or you pay attention to this or this is the guy to to blame for this if uh you didn't like what happened
but i really i really get mad at myself when i do because i realize i realize fully there's no really redeeming value for T TV no
uh-huh yeah he may have been the last of the old guard i don't know
so i didn't want to get into doing anything there it's just uh so far it's okay you know we haven't had any problems with it
because she was so skinny and then all these other people are coming up around us and
and i think uh in some districts you know there's a a party one party or another that has such a lock on it that uh you know why vote when it's decided already
yeah i voted absentee one year i really was going to be gone so i i did it but uh it was nice i would be tempted to do it again
outside of Boston
yeah i like the campgrounds that have a nice shower
you know what do these people think they were getting into when they joined the military
okay i'm i'm Kyle Hunt too if you ever come to to Dallas area well we live right by the airport
and uh and i'm i'm i'm especially sorry for the people that are you know have spent all these years trying to deal with it emotionally because you know until the last past four or five years nobody ever really worried about that for them
schedule a under uh well it's the same place it's the same place you put uh interest but but see that's what that's what makes Texas squirrelly laws that uh you can't you can't take out a a second mortgage uh like some states where you can take out the mortgage and declare that and so uh it's fully deductible the laws are a little squirrelly but it basically comes down to it's not in your best interest to borrow money from a tax standpoint
to go beat up on people and i think that i think we need to a little more justice at home i'm not sure how we get that  whether there's a connection there but
coming out of the TV that just doesn't make my day you know
at least i was able to to spend you know those first months with them
i was born in sixty two so when did it end
really how'd you hear oh we're not even supposed to be talking about this though are we
which one did you get
so you know it's a lot different now and what's it gonna be like in another twelve years when my uh oldest son's in high school
oh probably November December until March or April i guess around April and then i went ahead and built the breezeway and the garage because i thought it was too cold to be pouring concrete outside in the winter time
okay i'll let you go ahead
i think if if he was uh healthy San Francisco would have stomped those guys it wouldn't have been much of a contest
you too have fun up there
so but i was real disappointed in that and then Kindergarten Cop like i said i you know i just i don't even remember it  my mind must have just been somewhere else so
i would  when i was in school um i was supposedly in one of the best school systems in the country in Fairfax county and i'm i think back and i i don't feel like i i could have learned a lot more and don't feel like i learned as much i've only been out of school high school for four years but i think i could have learned a lot more and i've i worry about the children that are in
and then i go no no maybe i sleep more than ten hours you know and
yeah clocks is what i meant i can i'm going crazy my daughter's playing the piano and i can't think
not at the moment
uh probably uh in the last few weeks the biggest uh way i've had of keeping up with what was going on in the Gulf was CNN and i think maybe that's probably true for everyone
well see that isn't too bad  a couple hours
yes that that sounds wonderful i we uh we have family reunions not on a regular basis and there's mostly in my wife's family uh my family's very small
uh we uh then i stopped teaching after my husband's business business was established and we had two children and i stayed home with those children and
i think that adds to the diversity i think that uh i like that uh there i know you know John Wylie Price i don't know if you kept up but he's been protesting that
i mean you're just with them
oh okay yeah do you have uh do you have a family okay well that's probably influenced maybe a little bit
yeah it was nice talking to you you have a good day bye
how interesting i can hardly wait
they they just like to get in and dig
i was just thinking the same thing it's like we haven't had Chinese in a while let's have a shake up we get this uh there's this take out Chinese place that i mean you know stone's throw from my apartment here
and so you know i use it um both in school to do uh spreadsheet analysis for various uh businesses that we're studying and also uh you know it hooks up to normal printers and what have you and uh works pretty well in that mode as well
all right when i was uh in my early twenty twenty one twenty two years old i was working for a a guy in a gas station
that's close to uh South Padre oh Corpus okay
you can use that i don't know why you can't use other credit cards for business that way
yeah i think what we need what uh the government the state government needs to do is get in there and cut spending because when they got all this fraud and waste going on they need to just get in there and and get out the garbage that's in there right now i mean i once heard that uh uh for the for the federal government at least that if they uh uh well for like on the welfare system if they gave all that money directly to the people every welfare recipient would be making like forty five thousand dollars a year
i i seems like it was on a Friday Friday or Saturday
huh-uh huh-uh my air conditioner went out but i mean  ten years but uh i mean as far as major there's nothing major with the car
but uh i think they still have a little i think they're still such a a young team i think they still have a little bit to go before they reach the potential that it did when ever Bradshaw was playing
well they weren't negating
and so i end up lots of time not doing anything at all
i know it just has that i it looks several times in the last couple of weeks it has looked rainy that day and not not done anything and we have a lot of trees
and uh he had a torn rotator cup
i uh for the longest time i i'd gotten rid of my gas credit cards and then all of a sudden i started getting a flurry of these things so i i did i have picked up three gas credit cards in the last couple months
yeah they're not worth a year or some people unfortunately just just can't even afford it you know or whatever i mean the Peace Corps doesn't pay very well
okeydoke good-bye
so i mean it's like you know the the joke with the Yugo you know it's like yeah you you know like when your uh car runs out of gas just throw it away
several i mean it's it's it it's funny the way the business works because there're so many things that are enormously out priced
i don't know and and but you know when you go to the store and and you're trying to figure you know well this box is is uh is is twelve ounces and and this one's uh uh three pounds um and you
uh-huh oh sure there are high schools as large as our community
yes so i i you know think that there are very few men who still feel that way and very few women who will tolerate a man who feels that way
well you know they they they've started towards a little bit of the debit card have you seen the debit cards where they actually debit your account when you
yeah well i think a lot of it is the parents are totally irresponsible too we're talking these kids are fourteen years old The parents might be thirty years old
oh that's there for direct yeah the direct sun beating on it yeah yeah that's right
maybe we'll talk to you again alright bye-bye
right i i think that i i mean i wouldn't be so upset about the amount of taxes paid if it weren't for the fact that they don't they don't go to any place you know you you don't see it going to any place where it belongs
oh that's great sound like you
yeah if you wanted to you could uh but you could do the whole presentation and slick it up and edit it and make all kinds of changes and modification till you had it down pat on the Amiga once you had done that i mean including hooking up a camera to take pictures of things like maybe you want to do a a a a presentation on how to run some piece of gear well you want to take pictures of it you might want to take pictures of it running
yeah one year they were they were just everywhere i don't know what it was we had a real rainy spring and then it was all year there was
and uh you know they absolutely no regulations no controls whatsoever and they had destroyed entire forests and what not just because the air was so polluted that's that's the kind of things that uh you don't see in this country and that's that's why i think that you know it's it's i don't know if you can ever do enough but uh i think it's all relative to the to the time and place and i think right now it's it's it's pretty much under control
i'd rather be doing that than housework
uh-huh well that makes sense and then you run into again to um the bureaucracy in running it you know how you going to cover that many people because we've got a lot more people now than we did then
no not by a long shot well well you know we're not sending back as many i mean people think we're sending back a lot we're not sending back that many yet there's still a lot of them over there a lot of them a lot of airplanes a lot of ground forces
now just look at that money the government could save if they didn't have all of those days off all those holidays
no but the idea though is well is if if you could put two or three families in a in a together they'd be a lot easier and apparently they all just save their money and and uh and buy a bunch of things
i imagine oh that doesn't that sounds good
and that's how he basically got her off by by casting a shadow of doubt saying well this other his daughter did it you know and because this other will was had her name on it you know and all this kind of stuff but actually she had done it after all and he figured it out after he made her innocent and then that was right before he was going out to the big news conference you know to
but i think the US is one of the few countries that still do
oh probably Amy Grant is the biggest one yeah she's even she's got a song right now that playing on a few of the other stations it's called Baby Baby it's
but uh i mostly went back to work because i was tired of doing without things  you know the money was the issue
uh that's still a good hour ride i guess
with the worms yeah i have quite a bit of problem down here with the squash bugs and haven't figured out how to get rid of those yet
yeah i it it it was it was it was comical i i sat there and watched the just watched CNN and just giggle all night you know uh oh this is great George Bush is in
i remember the last time that we had to go vote it was like man just to get up there and do it was major effort you know
well they have these there these real like real strict laws you know they have to hose down the streets like every every other day or something
i just i usually yeah okay well it's been fun you have a good day
i know we do that too you know and at the first year because i was from the city when we got married and the first year that we planted i couldn't figure out i mean the well the first year after
but it's a real different show than it was when it started it's it's funny now and it's better but it's real different than what it used to be but you can't be uh so um you can't be outrageous
when i travel i use them
that you know put give out uh nonbiased information just general information on how the candidates stand on certain issues that you know you can make a decision on how you feel about certain issues and who you want
and it's pretty nice especially during the Summer it keeps everything wet instead of wilting
they're great for playing games my brother
of like when the buffaloes are when they're chasing the buffaloes and everything you've got to be where you feel it you really truly do i would i mean
we could save the country but
um we usually go pitch a tent and we stay out there for the weekend or um for the week matter of fact i think we're going to go again in in May
but he did both
and it's time consuming so
and i thought that was really neat
and uh most most of our debts are from before we were married and we're trying to get rid of you know student loans those kinds of things
rapidly but uh Gorbachev Gorbachev Gorbachev is i don't know i think i think you you're right he's a chameleon he's just a he's he he's just he seems to have flip flopped on you know uh uh you know when they first came into power when uh President Reagan was in he was this real nice guy and he was
into uh committing murder get getting rid of her husband
that's interesting that the military saw that and did something about it you would have expected them to be the last ones to
that's uh that's uh but uh i i guess the winter the winter wasn't that bad down here really
and that's uh that i can honestly see the peer pressure there
that's an excellent movie
yeah so that saved the bare spots and uh you know also eliminated mowing the uh that area of the lawn
um-hum um-hum yeah some sort of educational process i'm not quite sure what
um-hum i didn't i didn't see that
no maybe it was i think it was the South East area from Dallas my daughter my daughter lives down in Rowlett and she was telling me about it yeah i can't remember what the town was some little area
and so obviously it didn't work in California
we find it especially useful because my husband retired over a year ago and we travel quite a bit and we we like to leave a credit card when we check into a motel in case we want to make a phone call or
well i mean if if you know what your routine is you can do that by yourself and you probably do
yeah how about how about uh long term do you have anything uh for as far as as far as savings go for long term
um yeah i think it's a territory
so if somebody brings you half a dozen tomatoes it doesn't do you any good because you already had a half a dozen you know pulled that day
yeah are overmedicated too
uh larger plants up around up around one twenty eight  um we've got reports that uh during the night too like they blow off their their stacks from uh the
you know whether uh uh we would want to invest in in private schools as they're growing growing up because you know just in the Dallas area um we're not real comfortable with the with the public schools
uh besides that i i can't imagine what kind of uh uh bureaucracies we'd get into and expense having it be full time oh you're going to go to this camp and you're going to you know like um back in the Depression the CCC the the construction corps that went out and did things that was great it was needed it gave folks some jobs and we got some great public works out of it but
so i hadn't hadn't really thought about that
uh-huh right you know we go out to eat a lot of times
i think this is because the kids are getting to me
um-hum uh-huh yeah see i've got a on my stereo i've got a a uh turntable and then i've got a dual cassette so i can record off other cassettes
you know much direction in that area  and and then of course Grandma always seems to provide a a lot of things to a lot of toys and things yeah there's a lot of stuff just there to to let your imagination go wild with you know of course the new thing is the Nintendo
i don't know what Philadelphia's going to do without Buddy Ryan it might be interesting to see
no yeah and i also spent uh eight years with TI out in uh Ridgecrest California
and he came back he was a civilian again and his father said well if you
um-hum right i made a apple pan downy when the pastor and his wife came over and she didn't eat it
well that's fantastic and on whole on i would say that they're
they couldn't make this kind of money they couldn't live that kind of life style anywhere else
what what do you use to to download into the system can you put hook up a a floppy to it
uh the Houston Astros so i mean you know i've got quite a few
put all the money into the expansion box and all this that and the other and uh things just kept changing so much and i kept getting rid of them and i finally said well you can't do this  you've got to buy something and stick with it so i
oh they when he was riding back to the settlement and they shot his horse out from under him
yeah yeah i know Gene's in Sherman now
so any way i work in a big prestigious place
well how about you are you an exercise fanatic
yes yeah maybe we don't want those people voting
i was down in Florida working and uh during during the summer some how i got a hold of involved in a a marketing organization that marketed uh replacing those uh whole life policies which aren't very good insurance policies people are losing you know and it losing money or not doing as well as they could
like um in the warm weather it's always shorts and a T-shirt or a button up or something like that and then in the winter time it's jeans or or pants i usually um you know college is so casual you really don't want to dress up unless you you uh have a job and you have to be there right after school or something like that
yeah um we have a couple we have like a steel mill and a couple refineries and stuff and i know there's a lot of air pollution going in there and like they they get fined whenever they do the air pollution but
i always told my dad when i was a kid and he made me do it i said i can't wait until i'm old enough so i don't have to do this anymore
all right when i was uh in my early twenty twenty one twenty two years old i was working for a a guy in a gas station
yeah i used to have a  that that could read me better than any human being in my life
and then you can kind of keep an eye and you can make judgments and make comments or whatever you want but at least you see what's going on and uh you always have your house welcome then then your children'll think that uh you know you're cool parents and all that you know
yeah  but it's it's  nah you don't count on Social Security but it's it's that's what i'm saying they need to do something else
um yeah we we took out actually my wife she's the one that ran the budget you know i just brought it home and she had to stretch it out wherever it was going to go but she would allocate so much at at at that time when the kids were growing up  so much went for groceries
um-hum oh i know that's really awful but but i uh understand that this is kind of typical for this time of year the rainy season
that that must be a fairly recent release
um yeah container gardening is really pretty easy because i've done some of it before
well i primarily listen to classical music when i have my druthers partly because i find it more soothing i don't know a lot about classical music so far as uh any background in music but it's the  the music i enjoy the most how about you
but when you when you when you simply drilling a hole i mean a real simple thing like gee i need a hole there
uh-huh how old how old are your kids
definitely well he was a good player i guess i don't know he just never i don't know for a while there he just
well thank you very much bye-bye
didn't make me have um to much trouble and
yeah that has its plusses for sure
going to i know
and you know away from the capitalistic approach so it's kind of like you know we're moving in the in a kind of a direction toward each other
yeah me either it's kind of like they they gave me the topic and i'm like football jeez it's been a long time
well it depends if they're cooked in
and he uh i don't think he didn't apply i don't think he'd get admitted there but he's starting to get enough motivated he wants to go there that i think he'll go to Richland and take what he needs to have to take to qualify in Tech and then try to go to Tech the next year
yeah they civilians or uh military
i guess the the problem with that is there's no true authority in any kind of international verdicts
oh yeah it's not over crowded
boy that's a fact yeah well a lot of my camping was up in the Arbuckles as i was growing up there's a place that used to be called Platte National Park up around Sulphur and Davis and and not too far from Turner Falls
how does it how does compare have you can you compare like how does it compare to the Post
yeah it's it's i i i find it very strange um more people you know real Met fans don't like the Yankees and real Yankee fans don't like the Mets for some reason
last night i did  about thirty minutes of riding a bike and a few like three different types of uh uh weight lifting for my legs and and my hips
and uh he sat in his car most of the time and and uh listened to his tapes and fortunately he didn't keep them crank them up too loud but he uh he stayed in the car and did what he could have done at home as it were
yeah well i i have another thing that i thought about too um for instance when you try to save money and you earn interest on whatever your investment is and you know we're not typically talking about big dollars but here you feel like you've you've done something good you've you've earned your interest and then you have to go back and pay taxes on it so the real amount of your savings on that is is not much
maybe that's why they're
yeah i think it's getting better more competitive
yeah there's there's always a drawback to everything i mean i don't know well
yeah that's something i've it's interesting to me people who watch people who are that know how to paint i just felt like that's something i've never been very good at or very good at drawing or anything
uh transportation expenses i guess you own a car
you know um i used to think Dallas was better than Houston because their zoning for where you can put a house next to a now it looks just like Houston to me you know
right yeah there's a difference
but i like uh i like the Giants i i kind of think they snuck into the championship this year this past year and and i'm not so sure  they'll get away with it again but
well i've i've lost most of my hair so that's no real problem
yeah i never lived anywhere near Los Angeles
and um i enjoy photography as a hobby
yeah it's not very good
do you do Tex-Mex
yeah they should they should clean clear that up it wouldn't take them much to put a stamp on uh on the uh juice cans as easily as the soda
yeah i understand did you exercise between your first child and your second
yeah i'm glad that i'm glad that i saw Ghost before it went
what what are you saying oh uh my husband says i might buy it but i i don't really usually consider that an option
your concern on the economies was one in terms of if it became a state would that put even more pressures on on Puerto Rico or pressures on the US in terms of aid or
yeah i don't i i couldn't see it worth getting a nomination for uh best picture
right you can't just wear your sweats and an old T-shirt and
i i yeah um i i suspect the apathy is is due to something like people just feeling that that their vote doesn't count anyway i mean why why bother voting if um if your vote won't make a difference so for instance in um the last presidential election i'm sure a lot of people thought oh Bush is going to win either way why bother voting
on top of those recreational vehicles
there were you know he's supposed you know he's this actor right and he's he's playing a a cop well he's he's he's hanging around with a cop trying to pick up the the stuff i think he did an excellent job in not being too much of a cop
oh my gosh just a baby
okay well you see it saw it out there then too
nursing home that we finally had fortunately she only had to stay a few weeks and she was able to to return to her apartment again but it's really a big uh big decision as to you know when to do it
yeah what about uniform sentencing
trying to keep in shape that way but you know it's hard to find i mean it's really hard to find a place that's going to offer water aerobics because what i'm finding is that if they do offer it you get the crowd of women that are i think they feel this is going to be an effortless sweatless way
i did the papering you know when we built but that's not my uh that's not my cup of tea
i mean like Kevin Costner did all of his own scenes and uh they had to teach a wolf how to to howl uh-huh that's the part they had trouble finding was wolves
okay you know basically the size of uh the area around Richardson
yeah i found
uh-huh that's it's it's interesting because it's my mother's parents well actually my father's parents both of them sort of you know they just died of something um but the my grandmother my grandmother's case which is very sad she fell she came into New York to visit and she fell at the airport going down some steps and spent you know six months in the hospital but it is was still it it was it wasn't
so you can do it relatively quickly
sometimes i have
that's getting up there
oh really well i i'm picking Duke because uh they just won it
oh well yeah when i uh my family used to live in Littleton Massachusetts and when we moved in there we had a uh really wet backyard and uh my mom wanted a vegetable garden so we trucked in uh i think it was seven what was it cubic seven yards cubic yards i think that's how they measure dirt but
uh my goodness she went out on one job she was only seventeen i can't believe the lady gave it to her she said she interviewed nineteen people and she was the one she hired this was uh a three week old
i mean there is it's it's a blackening seasoning
okay did you get did you get the booklet on as to get the gifts and all that
and he had to get two new ones too so  i i i'd never heard of it before so my mouth was open the when you mentioned that that circumstance
air tight yeah so that even that doesn't doesn't create a problem but i think uh
at least we had a good conversation anyway yeah
well i yeah enjoyed talking to you all right bye-bye
yeah i definitely agree and i remember back in high school being on the debate team and that was one of the subjects one of the debates should we have you know national health care and i remember debating for it
uh-huh i think we do to
and apparently the Rangers last year won a lot of one run games
yeah well um i think the weather lately has been um a bit warmer than i would expect this time of year
and i noticed parents not spending time with their children and and going out and doing things and you know i knew like the kids next door were all into cocaine and
there's some one at the door so well i'm i'm going to listen we always
that kind of ups our stock in there just a little bit it makes us more legitimate so now what they're saying is that well since we won whatever we say goes because it's a kind of a might makes right attitude about it and you know we've got the power
but i'm really not for sure though if  well i'll let you go and we'll talk to you later okay bye-bye
yeah well it's kind of hard for me to talk about buying cars because i just got mine paid off about a month ago and i yes i don't want to think about buying a car for a while i just want to enjoy not having any car payments for a while and
and i enjoy it it's relaxing and you kind of get absorbed in it so the time goes by you know before you realize anything's going on and i play the organ sometimes uh just for my own satisfaction  not for anybody else's ears because i'm not that good at it but i like to bang the keyboards once in a while how about yourself
yeah surely we've made it  well it was nice talking to you okay you too bye-bye
part of me says that i'd kind of like to do it just to see what it's like to be in that position where you are playing you know life and death with somebody else could i bring myself to do it
i mean i i work for TI so i don't do drugs you know
um well that's good
and and really i mean North Americans i think are when you say that even i think i mean i tend to think of Americans and Canadians i just don't think of Mexicans as being North Americans although i guess strictly speaking they are
well you know it's it's that easy to say but boy when it's forty below and you're shoveling snow and it's forty below it's uh
they haven't really had any good sales on plants yet
yeah yeah that in-fighting can really destroy a team and its ability to win
the me decade uh-huh
some reason during the night the the door was not quite wide enough for it to get through and uh the next morning uh when my roommate got up and and uh did not feed it right away it decided that it was going to protest and so it jumped up on my bed and anointed my blanket for me looking looking at me eye to eye all the time while it was doing it
uh i don't know but people the other day i went into a bar and this guy asked me to dance all he saw was my hair
well yeah yeah it it helps a lot with the walking because otherwise it's just plain boring
but uh even the small towns now though has really changed from when i was a kid but now i'm raising children it just it really is
oh well he made it at fifty it was a magic number for him and and uh he went at fifty and he still works part time at other thing you know
uh-huh i've never watched that either
a cousin so uh uh but anyhow we got uh we got a nice uh picture and it came in an envelope that says Dances with Wolves so we've got to uh try to get out there and see that one
uh-huh is her family in Texas
i i believe i would probably tend towards that
is it her first one
but i uh sounds like you like one thing that i like like swimming you like that a lot
yeah and not get mad at the kid that's the other thing too that i i always felt Pepper the Siberian husky is really sweet she can i think the kids could walk up and they could literally probably stand on her back and she wouldn't even she'd kind of look at them  like what are you doing now she's real good natured about it
uh when i left here uh she had to change a set of plugs in the car  because she was up here for a month or so after i was
um-hum i think i think sometimes that you um you pick you become more aware of what you have
which i think is a is an invasion of privacy
no especially when going to spend the next eighteen years in school
yeah oh well that that's another system that i link in to i i network internally to Texas Instruments in Attleboro
yeah yeah yeah that was just a couple of years ago
it does and then i like um you know what daylilies are
uh-huh sounds like it  do you like to cook
great how to say no  and your like you'll do your own part you know you can do without necessarily spending much um-hum yeah
yeah but i don't know if they if  they if uh the death penalty
cat's lot easier  to take care of than the child you can go away and leave her for a few days
no yeah i know we had a tornado watch watch a couple of days ago but nothing really happened
really it does uh for all that well um i hope you have a nice day today
no and i i still really don't do that much as you say play games on it
i'll call you that's right and they all say that they're the best Visa but you know i definitely have the one that i've
well that's why that's why being strangers is safe we can
so they said okay we'll take care of it two weeks later i get another nasty letter threatening legal action
and make their kids stay there we found on in the area that that is letting us pay as little as two fifty an hour that's still five dollars an hour for two of our kids and it it's uh fun we try to keep it to a minimum
and um she had a daughter and i want to say her daughter was like six or seven right around first second grade and um at the time she kept another one other child um about a four four year old i believe but it was only like a part-time basis so we went over there and we questioned her about what she fed them and um what she did with them during the day and um you know just how she treated them how how her daughter was with the children when her daughter got home from school and stuff like that
to find the right one that's what we have to do though
well that yeah if the guys got some incentive if he's got uh you know if if he if he can raise enough uh coffee and bananas to uh where he's got something to protect other you know whether he can export or at least uh set up trade and all then democracy of a considerable interest to him
um or if it's their style or or just understanding the material and then i you know it some of those it's like i said it's like school you have to work at it but to me it's worthwhile in the end i feel good about it and i usually remember those a long time later and then i have the books that i read just
and uh Larry Bird's talking about retirement here i guess in another year
but there are a few companies here in Dallas that do
with the suits and uh white shirts and ties and what have you so that they all look exactly the same
two years ago was it
yeah i uh i guess you can get an earlier harvest by doing that
um-hum yeah um-hum yeah but i think in between we got a a group of kids a generation of kids who didn't learn to take responsibility because mom left to go get a job and dad didn't move in to fill the gap and so basically no one was taking the responsibility and i i think that's happened in a lot of cases
well uh i accepted Christ as my Lord and Savior and so i don't use drugs any more
like Jaws do you remember Jaws did you
i guess ultimately i'm not a a horribly bad speller although i have a tendency to lisp when i type so to speak
yeah it would be a good experience and you'd be helping people i'm sure very much and and i i mean not to put not to trivialize the problems of any immigrant group but i do know the Asian groups are having a lot of trouble i mean and part of the problem is that a lot of Chinese and Japanese immigration from you know decades ago has been very successful because they valued education and so forth they became a very successful immigrant group
well um the last car we bought was American because of because of that reason but have not been entirely happy with um several things about the car it doesn't seem like the quality is quite as high as i expected it to be
yeah okay well thank you very much bye bye
so the you know just for the doesn't really work out for us too economical to pay twenty dollars for a one way bus ride for these two kids but some days we have to do it some days it just works out to where i don't get into work early enough to get off
yep exactly i like things that uh you know two people can do but i like the quiet of doing things away you know kind of gives you some space for yourself and that's what i find in making the dolls and things that it gives me something that i can create and i like to crochet and knit i made some afghans and that kind of stuff i like doing things with my hands
sure once you're out of the house you're in the street
a way away so uh i'm you we're not usually watching TV  but uh but it is interesting uh they this time of year unfortunately it gets
and is right right is there is there um any is there a like a code of dress where you work do they ask
uh the the Giants' coach um what's his name i can't think of his name
yeah yeah yeah i love uh i like i especially like instrumentals
yeah i thought they had some sort of i mean i thought they were just poor people like us i guess not that's great
yeah that's super it's getting even better too
yeah yeah that's pretty bad
well i mostly listen to popular music i uh listen to it all the time in in my car so i i tend to be one of those people who switches stations a lot because i don't like commercials but uh i find myself listening to popular music and
yeah one of the things they tried to push through in Maryland and uh weren't very successful was that if you were an able bodied person on welfare
i'm with the Melpar division of E-Systems
but i've got a class tonight so i wanted to get these out of the way
yeah yeah course he he came after a legend too Tom Landry so he had some uh tough row to hoe there
yeah TI has a little uh owns a piece of land on the edge of a lake that borders that the lake is on the border of Texas and Oklahoma it's called Lake Texoma
as long as you've got the problem a big part of the problem anyway take a look at most of your politicians that are in now ninety percent of them
yeah and until we until we start changing our educational system i mean we're we're going to be we're we've already been overtaken but it's going to get even worse later i mean looks who's looks who's getting the engineering degrees and the the math and the science and everything it's not us
um yeah but not the same type of contests um
but i was thinking about though that that when you actually get to the milling equipment though when it starts turning
so you're still suffering then
to build a bigger intake center
like i said i like it i like the heat i like the i jump out of the swimming pool and i go into the hot tub
okay you too and thanks a lot bye-bye
uh-huh What uh what area did you live in
yeah yeah that's kind of like the the first well my first car was a fifty six Mustang and uh over the years uh all i had a uh Dodge pickup several years ago and uh i can't remember the size of the engine it was a three O seven or something like that
but well we also were interested in um you know being sure that he felt like he liked the people that he would be working with and that there would be some uh opportunity for
and and there was no
well i guess that's our uh five minutes uh so we'll yeah call this thing to a halt i appreciate talking to you Bill
you know uh because the you know the character actors the town the community people were just great they just seem so real you know they came right off the screen
yeah that's in in small communities that's a difficult choice but then the small communities are the ones with fewer problems
wow do you do ballooning too
more like embroidery or something but
every place you go you know the
now are if you if you if you pay your your monthly charge do you then pay separately for classes you're taking
and and vegetables right  you know so um you two would probably eat real well together
kind of like uh Jerry Glanville
not much yep
that sounds yeah really i bet it tastes good too
yeah isn't that funny i wasn't either i have uh
yeah so you're in division what now corporate corporate okay yeah that that must feel somewhat safer
yeah well did you move from the the Northeast
oh what are you majoring in
that's not too bad at all
i had i had an eighty eight that i really liked then it got wrecked and so i bought a ninety um because i i really liked my eighty eight and i've had a lot of problems with this one  so
overdoing it
and but there is a grass that you can use that is shade tolerant but i don't remember what it is but it's got like a boot on the front of the book
and i got hit by the same thing because we thought we were going to be real mountain men and uh we got up there and we had the little pills you're supposed to put in the water and make sure that it's potable
yeah i'm not very familiar with with the the state of their agriculture agriculture
uh still uh there's there's sort of a feeling of accomplishment with having you know a job and all that goes with that
that that was fun that was and uh then after that i my sister lives in Turkey so when i was like fourteen fifteen i went i went to Turkey and this Christmas i went to Turkey but basically
not really i'm not much of a fan of Nancy Reagan so i i don't particularly read um biographies or autobiographies
and we started doing um large quantities of chlorination of water starting around uh where we experimented with it in nineteen oh three and nineteen thirteen most of the major cities had chlorinated water
but then i just you know bundle it up and put it on the front you know the front walk every you know every Monday or every other Monday and
spring and fall are nice times of the year
they don't they they tend to make the elections if it's a not important election as it were they only open a few of the poles so i don't always i don't always vote at the same place so it's a little bit more trouble for me to well this election's going to be held this date and i've got to go over here
so does alcohol show up in these tests
any of your Christmas presents were packed in put them in this bag and leave it out with your recycling and we'll uh take all of those back and try to recycle them
you know and i got a lot of really weird ideas from that goofy movie
and um they said that they they have you have quite the problem with uh the ghettos i don't know they call it the barrio down there
yeah that was my teenage years i was born in fifty and and uh
uh with the pay and everything you know
and uh we stole it fair and square i think is uh
i think we looked at besides just you know what salary you would be having having now but when when could uh your salary increase and
and and they really really they come down and pound you real hard if they catch you dumping oil on the ground because it does go in and it effects the lakes and streams and it eventually winds up on the ocean here and it really makes a mess around around New England
have you ever sat on a jury either have i and i'm one of these people who votes regularly and i'm always registered wherever i've lived and i have never been called
i believe there was one case i don't i don't know where i read it or anything but i think there there has to they have to have put innocent men or women to death before i mean
well we uh my husband always usually always pays with cash but i never seem to have cash
and they never told us why these two people had such a vendetta against each other and the crime was uh uh attempt to commit murder you know and
i mean they had the same ideals and the same basic beliefs
so but you know i have found that with i have a two year old and i have found really though i'm kind of the opposite i'm more active now with him than i was before
because you know you you got your your your pilots and your your air traffic controllers your nurses your doctors
you know one of these days when i get a new car maybe i guess all of them probably will have CDs players by then but uh i'm not planning on doing that for a while i just got mine paid off so i'm going to stick with the cassettes and and uh you know until
oh but that's so neat because so many homes don't have that so you'll be cool all year around in the summer that's great
yeah yeah as he grows up he'll be even more and more too
and they just said well you know clutches are disposable and i said since when brake pads are disposable you know we know that but i never thought a clutch was disposable
uh being a a native Okie i uh i like to keep up with what the homeboys are doing uh
um-hum well i you've certainly hit on the key to any of it whatever we're going to do there has to be a profit there doesn't there the fellow who recycles the paper and the plastic and the aluminum he's got to be able to make a profit or he just isn't going to do it
yeah  and then it lies in a drawer for about five or six years at least
um-hum yeah i think their policy with them that though is um i don't know i think i wish we would have just i'm not that up on the policy of way i know that's kind of old but i don't know i just i'm glad that the Sandinistas aren't in power anymore because i think that they were  very wicked and uh probably some of the biggest drug dealers that the world has probably ever seen and i feel like most of the leaders in Latin America are probably you would be safe to say that they were just very very you know big into drugs
because since i'm an international student they want to send me back to Argentina well my dad wants me to go back so
correct and all the uh unnecessary military installations
yeah i i've heard a lot of bad things about them mistreating people and uh
great yeah i've been hearing about that
yeah i mean i've liked them ever since the season that they won the Super Bowl last i think it was eighty four i think it was
yeah they make a nice hedge uh
yeah hey you could well you can interpret that the what the TV show in the same way you can interpret the Bible well uh so
if it's winding down or what finding a taker
and uh it it it bites us over and over again the the
are so excited to be away from home they just spend all there time partying and they do a lot of things to themselves and that we don't really want our young people to be doing and
and uh i got so tired i i guess i just got so tired of hearing about the Dallas Cowboys and and you know whatever whatever the Cowboys did that day that it just kind of turned me against them
that's yeah where else can you get that kind of interest to start with
i think well now we had some friends that went to see it and they said it was okay so it might not be as i think they may be playing up um some aspects of the movie that aren't the main aspects
well the fact i live in it and there's just my dog and i now my dog is a wonderful traveler but i do have to stop for her quite frequently
well one of the reactions i have is that uh they put so much emphasis on the private automobile
just pretty oh yeah see that's what that's what gets me like well just like my brother he has got his five bedroom house
like an Uzi even and
that's cheating isn't it  well i think we like the same kind of music  nice chatting with you
is it i don't know maybe would you think a better student to teacher ratio do they have too many kids in most day cares for the people they have
i guess that's true but you know you've got to figure uh you've got to look at it like Carrollton is in Denton County
violent crime is on the increase from what i've seen and um our prison population has significantly increased i would say um our economy too is really it's just not what it used to be in the sixties or even fifties from history from what i've read and
yeah see that lot of people don't and that's
yeah i'm i'm assessing the damage outside right now i've got couple of a few shrubs i need to replace outside
yeah that's right that's right i know
i don't know but um it would be great and and if only i mean health is probably the one thing that people should be most concerned with you know especially that makes a good society when people are healthy and they're not you know they're not stealing for money to pay for their doctors' bills
right uh-huh well it's pretty good yeah  uh there quite a few children in the family so we have to
but it was an interesting uh uh line of reasoning where we've always thought or been told especially by the for lack of a better term women's libber you know we're just the same as men well maybe not and and maybe you shouldn't be exposed to the stress the same way that men have
ha we're not suppose to do this  i i can i'm from originally from Beaver County oh my God
oh well that's where we that's where i am Plano
probably uh the lifestyles and the size of the area we live in and an age can make a very difference in how credit cards are used um at this point in life i do not carry a credit card that i have to pay a service charge on
you know it's interesting um-hum
well a little more modern day but not much
well i agree i think that's what i'm trying to say
but they have one under you know my first name James they have one under my first name and initial middle initial then they have a a third one under my just my two initials
so yeah no but it it was just sensational because i walked in and they go oh my God they're still using this it was like this is the last year you can put your punch cards in and get your program out and you know
i'm into quantity and French the French restaurants aren't
but uh the church uh day care that my kids uh they don't go to a day care you know it's uh during Sunday School and stuff uh the people there are really nice
yeah i don't i don't have too much of a green thumb either so
you know it seems like when they go to prison it they really seem like it's a rough time for them and a murderer well go to prison oh he's just there to serve his time and get back out on the street
right well i would think they would be
no and uh unfortunately it shows i uh i'm supposed to i'm way overweight but uh i've had a problem with uh high blood pressure which of course is directly connected to it and my doctor's trying to get my blood pressure under control
oh mostly we watch college basketball
um and you know was a a problem with having five children needing to work a uh full-time job that was more than a full-time job i worked about fifty one hours a week because i worked every worked eleven hours every Sunday
yeah well i i don't know if maybe Communism's the right the right word for it but what we would there'd have to be some kind of there there may be a point at which at at which you've uh you might want to consider some kind of socialistic uh organization or socialistic setup to to deal with the problem and then be able to gradually transform back to a Democracy
but uh in the meantime we pray over our food because i'm always looking down my plate and i think man isn't this stuff was probably grown in who knows what you know kind of environment but i do take some vitamins on the side and i do like reading books like that i just i have a hard time a lot of the books are real new age oriented like Mother Earth and we're going to restore the earth i just don't see that i think i mean think to think that is almost it's hopeless to think that man can do anything with the you know what i'm saying it's to big than us and i think God's in charge and God's going to restore it when he wants to so sometimes i get bogged down in the
and i've been up there a few times but didn't accomplish too much because i just run down too quick
and they just when your number comes up your number comes up
nothing the one girl the boys ran i couldn't keep up with them but the one girl was like carrying a two year old on her back and i was able to keep up with her and follow her until the police police came you know so we would know who they were and her mother the police called her mother to come and pick them up
you know that's what i've heard too you know i heard that they just put them in there because they don't want to mess with them
that i i didn't really enjoy it as much as i could have if i worked at it a little harder
and and the ones that test positive have to retest after a certain period of time
yeah they say that's pretty good well how old are you
you know don't like the way you look don't like the way you dress don't like your hair don't like you know it's just something that always sets people off you know you either like someone or you don't like someone or you're just completely indifferent
don't affect ninety nine percent of the people who are right there when the news is being made
lots of lots of lots of luck on the job market
yeah yeah well i i uh i work with computers at work and then i come home and do and i have uh a little lap top at home that i just like to play with
a productive member of society But sadder than that he may never be able to have a normal happy life because it has strung him out so that he has anxieties now that are are almost uncontrollable i mean he he puts himself in the hospital fairly regularly thinking that you know he he's not sure if he's going try to commit suicide or not
to get in shape without having to spend anything or it's the geriatric crowd
at my uh my uh mother-in-law's house and uh
they do so they're getting paid
yeah well the Cardinals i don't know  i think the Cowboys probably have a a better team they just at the end of the season the kind of got messed up with Aikman getting hurt because uh Laufenberg just couldn't never really get it together at all of course he sat along the sidelines all season he never really got in a game never did a whole lot
yes well my grandfather he eventually completely lost
so what type of restaurant do you like
well it it's not sudden it's just that it probably doesn't hit the average person uh until it hits them over the head
my uh my taxes exceed my mortgage payment
have you ever done that i mean you sound like you may have been a couple one time
so have we been very very fortunate
well there there are a few out there it's i suppose it depends on who you're working for and where at
well i spent a year and a half in Japan also and i've seen how their sc hool system works and i they go by a complete rote system you you just memorize everything
uh yeah i think they are they they do get uh privileges privileges like that
and that was during one of my softball games and my husband had him and he just kept giving them to him and letting him breaking them
no it's it's a it's a it's a machine it's not exactly a sewing machine but it does it does sew the seam and trim the edges and all that stuff but there are other are other things that a regular sewing machine does that it doesn't do like you can't top stitch with it
San Marcus around in through there
you can uh you can get and i know when my children were younger um we found a lot of really nice tapes that they that they liked um there was an Agape music group and um i some of the songs i still find going over in my head over and over again because they were really um very memorable even though my children are now my youngest is almost sixteen but i still find some of the same tapes i uh some of the same songs from those tapes i enjoy
huh Raleigh well uh have you ever do you read uh US News
really well it's really lucky that you got away from that cause that's
that's right yeah but my preference is the one we saw before that was Silence of the Lambs
by themselves well you know people  just kind of given the money it's kind of depressing sometimes i think
no you an adult can't grasp something like that the enormity of it you know i mean i don't
i didn't realize it would melt so easily
i feel real sympathy for them so i really and and and by the way i feel the same way when i i just got back from Florida
i would agree with you there
and i think they finally put things together
i don't know if you're familiar with it Pamela Smart in New Hampshire
and things like that those are not those are not even expensive i mean you can pick up very nice ones for eight nine dollars
which is something different um makes them a little bit crunchy you need to chop them up real fine but um it makes them crunchy and that adds something new to it
well i do it all  uh yes i i try to grow uh uh a vegetable garden and
and he came to this country and one of his first jobs was to teach gymnastics and uh he use to make a living for a while doing gymnastics and swimming and in fact in Austria that was what he did for a living too but uh of course he came over here uh i don't know fifty years ago or something like that
uh-huh sometimes we have really good luck with them but then there'll be like maybe two years in a row that we can't get anything
yeah well yeah i like i like some of those things they come in really handy
that's overdoing it
oh that that would be that'd be culturally shocking
no we don't have mandatory we actually we're kind of slow up here and we've just started doing recycling probably last summer and it's all voluntary so that's interesting cities have a mandatory recycling
well you are not from that area originally i can tell
but it was interesting i had to go buy a hoe and a rake i mean the whole works because i've i've lived in an apartment for so long i've never had that kind of equipment so that was that was interesting to go down there and and get all that kind of stuff
and and those are shall we say blue collar that that your work the assembly line type or technician some engineering uh you may not have the the self-employed businessman willing to go because he though he may be
i mean obviously it's gotten a lot worse but you know just like you say you go through there and you watch all these trucks and they're just coughing out all kinds of stuff some of them spitting it out so thick you can't even see past it
that's uh boy uh that must be a wonderful feeling to be in that profession and be able to make a contribution like that
um-hum that's true i i like i say i don't have any problem with people using firearms you know for sporting purposes or hunting purposes i just think it's just may be a little too easy you know to acquire one on on a whim of some sort
oh yeah they they spent more money last year than any other team in the in the league and they were you know toward the bottom of the league uh so it's like i said spending money doesn't guarantee you uh winning a pennant it really doesn't so
yeah yeah that's that that was also in the movie yeah
no we have six and seven no six and then one is at seven ten or something like that
yeah and uh i was talking to my older sister the other day and uh she said she had to get a new car and they were thinking of getting something big enough she's got two teenage kids and they go camping a lot
right well that's neat well i  i have a my daughter has Precious Moments collection and i like that because it's a it's real easy to
uh-huh yeah right they're pretty tricky
yeah i don't i don't regularly watch news or uh newspaper i would say i get probably most of it from my friends you know they finally told me hey there's a war  going on oh okay
yeah thanks a lot you y'all work at TI you you do okay oh really wow that's interesting i work in the wafer in the wafer fabrication in
but i think that uh the changes in the next twenty years will probably be just as drastic you you'll see more women CEOs and more women holding public offices
less than half i was kind of surprised to hear that
but there's so many more people that are homeless and yeah
that that it's gotten worse
so we don't really see anything if if i need something i'll go and you know use the teller machine or if she needs something she'll go and she'll use the teller machine so we don't really um have a lot of cash anymore
oh yeah those do pretty well here don't they
right uh you know things like that so uh that's what makes it worth it uh because he's handicapped and he's at home all the time so so uh
yes it's it's really sad
Park Suite yeah right across the street yeah
i've talked to i don't think they were students one i think worked at a university university um and the furthest away i've talked to someone has been New York
i've i've only known two people in a nursing home and you know it was my grandmother and grandfather on my father's side and i just heard through my father what was going on and uh
now we went to see the Jagged Edge and that yeah so it's it seems like you know that kind of the thriller suspense and not not real um
right know well that's true well a friend of mine went home this weekend uh he lives up in the uh Pan Handle
and then uh oh no let's see i went someplace i can't remember the name of it some other place we went um but we went to one and they serve you i mean the hamburger was a pound of meat
mine is like pulling a big house behind you you know
that's always a good thing vegetable trays always go over so well because i think people get tired of eating junk i mean i think they like to have healthy stuff too you know it's
that's right uh-hum that's right it's really nice uh-huh yeah i'll have to admit i don't i do my own yard i i really don't enjoy doing that i enjoy having a nice looking yard i just don't enjoy the work that it takes to get it done
i mean it's not really government for the people and by the people i'll tell you that
views huh political views huh
oh is he the reformed um gambler yes yes yes
so oh that's great that you have them are they oaks that around there
i enjoyed talking to you bye-bye
i uh try to do what i can and uh we have two vehicles uh and uh on the Honda which is the older vehicle
and it's like and then you know you have people you know going you know it's like everywhere you know you have some people that are glad some people that are saying shit and the other people that are going oh my God i'm somewhere in the middle you know it's like wow am i going to have to do it
yeah yeah and they still do he
the home that uh we bought back in the early eighties was uh was was typical tract home and we were uh trying to find something that would would get us into the housing market as it were thinking that someday we'd move on uh the economy however changed that a little bit and looks like we're going to be in this home for a while but uh it's not too bad
it's basically the more the business business end of it than the programming end of it you know
and the reason that i stayed at the school i did was because at Evanston township which back then was like one of the three larger schools in the country
uh the profit sharing the stock options there are a they offer a lot of ways for you to save money too if you have any extra you know that like the uh code over the two for one type of thing or they match half i guess it is
no i'm not that much on hard rock but he does have a lot of cassettes of uh CDs that i like the i guess you'd have to call it soft rock i like Rod Stewart and and some of the things he does
i don't know maybe it maybe it should be stressed through you know public education in schools you know or something i don't know
and um you know every now and then the file gets so big that you know it moves slower than i'd like
we're going to be looking for a stud for this one pretty soon
yeah do you let your cats outside
well i remember Chucky Cheeses was down in Lewisville uh i haven't seen one here
absolutely well the other thing of course is the fact that they hope you will not pay your bill at the end of the month so that you will be paying interest
well talk to you later Tom Clancy it's called A Clear and Present Danger
yeah it was a great game
i can see that there might be a reason for one but i would hate to do that because uh that would be very difficult for my family financially to to afford a state income tax and most states have it i know and i've lived in states that have had it but way uh way financing is now if we had a state income tax i'd uh have a very hard time financing my house again you know paying off my mortgage each month that's so that's a problem um which just matter of we'll see what happens i'd rather have that i guess than have a state state lottery because when you bring
no i don't think they'll be able to carry it that far uh
oh i like that
that i taught physical education
because i felt that i was losing something or taking something away from me
yep it's tough it's tough
oh i see so do you
okay but you can't find no jobs like that
and maybe we'll get to talk again okay bye-bye
i see it's sort of like some people and ketchup yeah
but uh some kind of a national service uh concept that might be geared around reducing that would be a i think would be a big step so
this is going on my fourth week to do it
yeah now they'll come out in the pros
and and vegetables right  you know so um you two would probably eat real well together
that was a regular party machine huh
from your company because i know they i don't know why but you can use American Express and they give you an itemized bill and
you know like people that are in prison i mean we didn't put them there they put themselves in that situation and as far as like them uh entertaining the rights that they should have
really yeah yeah you're right about that but that that's really like an all time classic i mean i don't think anybody anything could ever beat that
alrighty well uh have a good one okay bye-bye
right it's it's not a problem either way like i said my only complaint is where they mixed them on the same car
well and i guess you know you always have to think about things like your gas mileage and stuff like that you know you
no i've uh you you can rent people's kiln they they uh you take your pieces to their house or their ceramic shop and uh pay them there's one woman that charge ten dollars a month for fire all that i wanted
and most of them are partying
i know when i sit down with the family and want to have the opportunity you know to talk
and see they do that as their job whereas you know for us it and they make it cheaper for us to buy so
um-hum yeah the first project project i started out one was a big one it was uh it was of a lady and she was kneeling and it was about fifteen by twenty maybe
no i don't i have i i have some friends in Israel and and coincidently actually my wife is Syrian um
right it curbs the appetite and helps with the calories and all that stuff
so hello Mary
well it's been very windy and it's uh probably unseasonably hot for time right now
yes oh yes i was living up there when all that mess was happening
you know people just do it in their garage and then on weekends they go out and sell it and during the week they go back and do some more
that's good i've noticed on the like the department stores they sure do hate it when you pay double payments
yeah but the politics the politics gets worse in the small towns sometimes
sure no uh i don't know i i i usually don't talk politics with people especially strangers because it's a good way to get into an argument but
like that and therefore i feel it's an invasion of privacy because i thought all these people share you know what they're doing even though it's none of the business
that if the the laws and and uh were were harsher and were enforced
uh-huh uh-huh oh right right now i want to see Sleeping With The Enemy
oh they've been getting cleaner
yeah kind of fizzles out yeah that's true that's true
a different world from down there
yeah but you have to have a need i really have no need for it at all um i work for Digital Equipment and we have a powerful computer down at work
uh uh i've got a garage under the house
yeah well the sentences are so unbelievable i just saw on the news last night that they said the average time a sentenced murderer you know is in jail is two years before he's paroled and a rapists is like six months and a burglar is like two months
have um have you ever been to the Science no it's called the Science Place
well when i go to work i listen
uh-huh my husband did one last night and he just loved it he's been getting he got a real good topic
hum that's interesting i don't know mine didn't did not fall into the gifted category
the um i remember last year wasn't it raining a lot this yeah all that flooding and everything
we went in but what did we do we lost lives and and what were we trying to do who knows
he could fry yes to put it very bluntly he could fry yes yes because sometimes there are crimes worse than murder
but you know he can walk back to the little cabin in about five minutes from there but it's it's a ninety nine acre i think it's a ninety nine acre in fact they have acquired some more now that they are going they're going to clear but it's a long term lease from the corps of engineers
okay then that's uh kind of  a private
well i think i don't know if we've done five minutes but i'm sure that'll be
that you didn't want
so but uh i can't i just can't imagine i mean are those cars worth thirty or forty thousand dollars
all kind of weather from the Atlantic Ocean you know and that drives our weather nutsy sometimes we'll get the clouds and the wind coming the right way and the storms will just pour in moisture and pump anything from snow to rain depending on the temperature you know
and we grow a lot of food
out of your own jeans yes
middle class white suburban home and i did it um
and i mean i still unfortunately have to be very disciplined in in doing my work at five in the morning and ten o'clock at night but
he wrote he's the one who wrote uh Red October A Hunt for Red October
and the book to me was far more frightening than the movie was yeah he's a very good writer and he had a way of putting you in that scene you know it was
uh-huh that's right when we had our pool done i had them to leave some extra loam you know for my garden so i had i had a lot of loam out there to start with i just turned it all up and mixed it all up together with it
um-hum oh you are constantly there's always something going wrong
uh why is it so sacred to have it on Tuesday and uh why couldn't it be Friday and Saturday i don't know what the ideal day is if you're trying to catch a weekend or maybe just Tuesday and Wednesday i'll bet you'd get a lot more people i think the news media has really they jump in there and they uh tell you the the that who won before seven thirty and before the elections before the polls are closed
no i haven't i don't know if i've even heard of that one it must have uh what's his name in it
i don't think i've ever i think i've that there was some girl there i've been there like maybe a dozen times but i actually like that site better than the other one just because of the type people that go to
yeah yeah yeah they did well i think that's the guy that uh it was like his story
huh-uh no the the cheapest ones now are like maybe four uh four or five five dollars
the then vice presidential candidates uh who really sort of i thought had a very demeaning attitude towards her
that that starts tomorrow night
yeah right right well well i think the same way with alcohol too personally it you know that that would probably be the next
and uh you know you there's a uh a nice warm feeling i remember getting out of doing things like that when i was younger i mean i was a Boy Scout and the whole bit and
um casual ones but with class you know not too fancy but uh i i won't go to a fast food place
won uh eighty three games last year which was just four more than they lost but we had an exciting time and that at one time in about the June July and August period we went to about eight straight wins
not a bit yes sir
yeah that's what my name is Fernando
and then what is the long-term effect of us burying that in the ground if that stuff
yeah different ethnic groups
because Sunday was really busy
yeah instead of being completely penned up
and i mean i thought so i've owned a house for um twenty five of the of the thirty two years that i've been here in Dallas and i just enjoy it so much and uh and and particularly the lawn i love it dark i love to see it get a deep dark green
uh-huh well when we had our house um out in Castroville the problem with ours is that the uh plots there are a third of an acre and
and we meet places it's like gee you guys don't like one kind of car do you
uh one is taking Latin and one has taken Spanish but not enough of it and uh i think we we down here especially should speak and California New Mexico and all that really
yeah that's really really unfortunate it really is
well you don't have a choice
yeah i i you know it's you know feasible i mean i know a lot of college kids who have them you know who had them but just depends
well i'm going to try to please clean up the house after my two children for about an hour  see if we can walk around okay bye
i i heard that it's been raining down there a little bit but it's really been that bad
yeah well the only thing that might save him is that in the backs of their minds they may think that they don't want to hurt him permanently
well have you ever have you ever taken any of those um what do they call this citronella lights have you ever used those
uh-huh that's right see we he couldn't do without it he but you know since he can just do it right there at work for nothing
yeah i uh yeah i uh started back to school in fact i was going to school while i was working fifty one hours a week and that's why i you know if you're working if you're taking twelve credits at night and you're working fifty one hours a week there's not much time left to spend with
i don't remember one from one station to another i keep forgetting one station
yeah i think another problem with the families uh is is the role of television
um you betcha i um however if you were living in Mexico in those conditions would you have several children
oh the day like today it's so nice outside you like to get out there and do something uh
do you have a particular local channel that you watch on television
we don't ever get anything from anybody when we're having to fight to get money to help us with this war we were just in
okay it's in the front of the engine uh say like directly behind the radiator or the water pump
in uh games and stuff because of uh
so that was the next problem he had to redo that too i
uh there's another guy oh what can what is his name oh durn  you would well you know when you're recording you can't remember remember
the the black guy that
that sounds like it might be a really good idea
yes because the character the the character that is so horrible is another human being And you're just drawn into his his horror of him that you begin to kind of like him
well yeah you know he was one of the few who've come through in history that can really perform uh we hope every team hopes their current quarterback is going to pull them through in a way Aikman has done some of that
no dealers will get get you on the oil changes anyway i took my car in one time many years ago for an oil change at the dealer and they charged me thirty dollars for it
and Terry Bradshaw i think is probably even better than he is or better or was was better than than Joe Montana is now because i of course  another another Steeler fan showing up here you know another black and yellow surfacing up here you know  this is the black and blue league up here in the corner
well excuse me just second honey i'll be with yeah go ahead
i just made my first job hop about eight months ago so uh
no no uh it was just for three days we must have done like uh sixty miles or something
yeah like who
move on yeah i think it's a little harsh to say that they should have to spend a year or two and and and force them i think that uh i think it'd be i think most i think a lot of kids actually do a lot of work and no one just realizes it
does it taste a lot like shrimp
well it was nice talking to you and good luck with the baby
we were working with that steel that's thousands of degrees hot and i would have to cover for him you know like i would have to do two jobs for someone just because they they think they're being smart or something
and it just seems to fit nicely so that i can get it read in about three days
sure at least one
since i am home with them and so i get a lot of time with them he needs to have um some time with them so he when he comes home he um you know it's his job at night he puts the kids to bed and he reads
yeah that's a strange situation you you're a citizen yet you can't vote
yeah yeah yeah i agree with you i i'm glad you mentioned that because i think i have to since i don't have the opportunity in the morning i'll probably catch the the head lines on T News that's a good point
uh you know i think i think that you know using a i guess what they call it is eclectic you know using drawing from a lot of different sources and making you know a a synthesis of a new type of music um
that you know put give out uh nonbiased information just general information on how the candidates stand on certain issues that you know you can make a decision on how you feel about certain issues and who you want
and the only thing you can remember is to try and stay together as much as you can because it's very easy to uh become go your own direction when you're so when you're working so hard and going to school too
and and uh again like you say there was and you are still a student and there's so much more you could have learned and but i i i don't know i think discipline i guess if i were to look at one thing we've lost well kids used to have a respect for the teacher i guess at one time but i think we've kind of lost that in out school system and i'm not really sure how to get it back i say discipline and that might be the wrong choice of words but it
uh the uh achievement for the let's see how are they putting that uh the school let's see the academic report board review board uh the dean's being it more involved with the athletes
so it was you know ten or so feet uh higher just a few weeks ago in fact uh a few weeks prior to when we got there and the camp the people at the campgrounds told us that uh asked where we were from and we said Dallas and they said oh well we had a girl die just two weeks ago in that rage of water
horrible but there's a lot of things you can buy that have soybean products in them to begin with that you don't even know where in there so um it's it's just a matter of learning you know
uh all of Mae West's movies and just kind of kind of go out and uh rent all the movies and uh uh you know just kind of go i guess you could do that you know get all of David Carradine's movies or uh um Segal to what's his first name
employees that there are and yet they're so important
yeah i've i've noticed that they haven't had anything great
but they need to pay for it too because they couldn't do that somewhere else
so it's not all stuff that TI makes
well then let's let's answer the second half of the question what limits ought to be put on it do you think
and and the schools don't don't really encourage to stay away from that you know the schools are there teach history and that we fought the civil war etcetera etcetera they don't teach them good values like drugs are bad i don't maybe i'm wrong maybe because i haven't you know been in that kind of environment for a long time but it just is amazing you know need to teach them good values
the the diaper service trucks apparently the fuel that they use and the fumes that they produce to deliver and drop those off
so i i cut i cut that thing up
yeah and what to do when they're faced with it
as long as you've got the problem a big part of the problem anyway take a look at most of your politicians that are in now ninety percent of them
um i don't know i think the the the guy should have been ousted out of there and now we don't seem to be as interested in in doing what's right
um because so that was that was one reason why i never considered it but now that i'm further along and i'm still paying these college loans
and i'm thirty years old and i'm kind of irresponsible but i have the morals that keep me from you know if i was going to go out and drink or do something i wouldn't do it in front of my child these people you know they bring their their Johns home and they bring their drugs home and the kids are just sitting there in the same room
um because it is so you know it  a friend of mine went traveled to Belize  and  and into Honduras hello
probably the only thing sometimes we'll take cash or the cans in and we let the kids get the money for that but uh for
yes and it was it was awful to hear what you know what some of these people really went through And i forget the percentage of people that you know that she had said and this was i mean she did research on it and everything
they're expensive to maintain just the chemicals are expensive
because it's eventually it's going to it's going to swing back
right to to actually be a leader uh a team leader and uh you know the Rangers really don't have any star players besides Ryan that uh i think the other players look up to because Incaviglia i don't think you know uh he stands out to be a a real leader
which surprised me that that uh through the jury discussion they were able to convince him against his original opinion so maybe that speaks well for juries
yeah i haven't thought about that much i i've uh wondered about it but i haven't really got concerned about it one way or another you know
uh deductions uh allowable deductions for companies they put those in oh four of five years ago uh you know the the different insurance companies and things started promoting those plans
yeah it will move you across the water and it would pull three slalom skiers without batting an eyelash
uh my brother's got a collection there they both uh do police work uh they go out and shoot and they're from the mentality that when uh uh guns were against the law only criminals owned them that sort of thing
huh  yeah we have we all have those kind of dreams too don't we  what i'd really like to have
and i really ought to take those quickly while i still remember something
oh how nice no he doesn't have one of those so
um-hum um-hum get a kitten yeah um-hum
yeah yeah it could be TIers uh i think probably are participating more than anybody else but
canoeing uh water in it have you been camping much
but uh i'd i'd like to uh eventually i'd like to work work up if if my wife does get interested and and maybe get involved in a league in a in a mixed mixed doubles league or something like that
well uh well uh we're we're some of the older ones in the family so the ones with small kids usually have ball games and kick ball things like that
no no and uh what let's see uh the most recent ones that i've seen are those two Ghost and uh Dances With Wolves but i rent uh uh videos do you
and uh we made that decision and uh so she after she had the first baby she stayed home and and we had a second baby and she's still at home
no but the idea though is well is if if you could put two or three families in a in a together they'd be a lot easier and apparently they all just save their money and and uh and buy a bunch of things
and um you're in Texas right
Alabama okay alright alright i guess close to the Louisiana border
they require them to um put their newspaper for recycling but the deinking process that they have to they use to take the ink out of the newspaper so it can be reused
yeah and you give them you know they get their free lunch and they throw most of it away but then they have their money to go buy dessert and that they eat
okay so uh what do you think about it
but i think if we can if we can expand the men's roles at the same time like your taking care of your child and your dad probably didn't very often i know i know mine almost never did
case that involved oh a couple thousand dollars i think it was
and they've got entire squadrons of those just standing by they used them in Afghanistan did remarkably remarkably well considering the terrain they were flying in but on a highly populated area like some of the Soviet cities would be with the weaponry that's attached on those things there is no place to hide if the bombs don't get you if the bullets don't get you then the then the nerve gas definitely will get you the only drawback on that little piece of machinery is they only got five minutes of air time they drink that much fuel
i mean that would be great
from the winter
yeah now my roomie on the other hand he is a power user
right we we find it hard to believe sometimes or hard to understand when uh
oh oh go ahead i was going to say my ex husband was i was talking for him last night and he was talking about going over to uh uh Iran or wherever their asking he's an electrician he's certified and he's gone to school and all that for it and they're asking for these specialized people to go over there for is a year and he was talking about going over there and i said you really want to do that
and if they were uh if if  if i had no doubt that uh they would be a hazard to to the rest of uh the population as long as they were alive uh yeah i could probably go along with that
you know run around and and play soldier well the reservists sure do we had a reservist here in North Carolina who who
so he he was kind of getting there but he's
no i i don't think so
the weather down here is a lot different than than it is uh uh at home  yeah
oh you plant oh
and uh now i got back i got kids in college and gosh i can't afford that price so i still keep them in my name but the guy who takes them calls me every year and says can i have the tickets one more year i say yeah fine take them
well that's makes sense though
yeah uh well some things are some things aren't you know
places like Ross Dress For Less and uh TJ Max um uh-huh
so you really know about them
you think so i bought a stationary bike but i find that if i sit on that seat too long it hurts
well in addition to to the river what we call it's the Guadalupe River it's uh has campsites all along the river uh but then there's also Camp Warnicke where you can get cabins you know it's right on the  River
and uh you know which is like what David Lynch's other movies were about you know the so i don't know i just i didn't think it was that good my wife liked it a little bit more than i did she looks she looks at more some of the uh more creativeness behind it you know she likes the different type of movies
where do you what area do you live in oh okay i live in Dallas uh Rowlett
and uh when i when i first heard about it i was very uh very defensive i didn't think it was something that that the companies ought to be doing
because i don't even bother with the unless i'm working on a bumper or something but the engine parts and all are all metric you know
yeah yeah well i certainly will Jack it's been real it's been real uh informative for me to talk with you and i i certainly enjoyed it
now are if you if you if you pay your your monthly charge do you then pay separately for classes you're taking
but we i mean even before i mean usually we you know we might have a beer but that's about it so
and those are going away
i think they'll always represent a threat whether whether or not there's an active cold war or not uh it's it's a a totally different economy based on different beliefs and and uh different priorities and uh given the the uh military powers on both sides i think it's always a threat
no i have no idea i don't think i don't think that was on ABC anyway i don't know what happened to it though
i had a friend that had a roommate that worked for TI and she saw this come up on the computer screen and ran it off
i spent uh i spent a year up in Colorado Springs at TI up in Colorado Springs
so that's better than ignoring you i think
i know i know the shortcomings too
it's not necessarily it it's not necessarily scary as it is suspenseful i mean it's not
yes that's interesting are there are there any other specific things that that you feel like where where you feel your privacy to be invaded on a day-to-day basis or either growing on a growing frequency
yeah that's right and they probably will soon so
a store in my house where i've got the uh the hardware and the software and i also do repair work on the system if if i started using a different computer at home then i wouldn't be using the the software and the hardware and it would be that much more difficult for me to try and market it the the product
well you know still be on yeah yeah now they got a lot other crap involved and so i don't know you're right i think some of the tones uh of the the the daily prime time is is questionable that could be uh
well it was nice talking to you i think i'm going to have to catch my daughter before she eats any more candy when i'm on the phone that's her sign that she can do what she wants to do
i don't listen too much right yeah i've heard of her uh-huh uh-huh
but it's like three fairways over
and so obviously it didn't work in California
they look like they've got yeah no no it's not like a no
he's got several out that i like and uh matter fact
well not that you can see it a little better and it stands out
he was really funny
but uh so i don't know i it'll be interesting to see how the next uh few years go
and but uh-huh exactly and so i think that kind of control is would be good
yeah i'm being single and no other responsibilities for yourself i guess you know it's i can i can i've been pretty happy i've i've haven't tried to upgrade myself right now that's uh
you both do it that's nice do you have um a lot of flowers and stuff
and uh then moved to Dallas about three years ago so
and uh uh i don't know it's going to be interesting
either course the service i'm at i don't think gives a education uh after service
uh i enjoy reading different types of things
yeah i know they take their softball serious or their soccer serious i mean
um it's really tough he says in a lot of cases where he has to make the decision so i guess in a lot of those cases it's it's all up to him as oppose to a jury
and losing one run games
yeah exactly or the way you look or the way you you know your age or anything i think that'd be a wonderful way to do it
yes all all young Americans they did not specify you know exactly what young means
i had never thought about that i could probably plant one and bring it in and just like i bring my plants in every year
and i haven't figured out how to get that off i guess i'll have to take that door down and really get it good
and uh because i noticed that uh like even going to church uh seems like people really dress up a lot more uh here in North Dallas going to church
i did pick up uh a lawn sweeper
four out of five hurt
yeah yeah those have really cropped up years of late but uh
Well i most of them have uh the option the American American made cars have uh the the miles per hour as the big scale and they're little tick marks uh sort of hidden on the scale which shows kilometers per hour
i'm not kidding my husband was like totally freaking out he said i can't believe it look at that
you go to high school you you know you work you go to college you get out of college and you get a good job and you work and and none of this you go spend two years in the Peace Corps to expand to broaden your horizons
uh-huh yeah right and how to treat them right right and who wants to be treated which way
yes i am on staff to Hal Ammon to GTE
uh-huh the kids thought that was wonderful
oh i go for that yeah
so much more complex yeah
okay i like country western it's my favorite yeah Willie Willie Waylon and the boys
oh is he the reformed um gambler yes yes yes
yeah i'm sure you know my sentimental favorite would have to be Philadelphia but i i sure am scared of them Giants
and how it fits with the character right
to uh kill another mother
i kept waiting for where's some reference to this God damn State of Texas and the role that they played either leading up to or in the Civil War they might as well have not even
but you know it is it is a commitment and perhaps these people would rather be doing something else just as constructive and we're making them do that
and i do i do i do like it actually um i would never live there i think i'm too Americanized and um sort of have too much you know too much invested in sort of the the easy life but i do like the food
yeah it's it's it's like a fad thing i i don't know it's i've never heard of it in the last five years i've used so much of it that
before i start in any exercising
um-hum so that that's pretty good
isn't it England that has it all state run or something
well i've been pretty lucky in that respect i don't charge like i say i've i been trying to to not charge except for emergencies
so i have to hang these things high so they can't get to them especially the catnip
like i said it was noted for you know it's food
well i can relate to uh when i decided to choose a college uh it really had very little to do with academics
yeah we are uh somewhat conservative but as far as the uh socially our crime rate has increased and although it's more publicized as opposed to what it used to be it seems like
i see well i i wish i would have been paying more attention when i was out messing around with uh my dad when he was uh out looking at the cars he's he's a pretty good little handy man but uh i i never did pay any attention never i never really was very interested in cars so uh i'm i'm just the type that if it's got gas in it it should it should be going
really gory um
yeah you'd have the whole town on you didn't you
i wish our time were like yours and then we could get i like to watch Johnny Carson and watch the eleven o'clock news but it makes it so late
sort of like lawyers you know
it looks just like orchids in different colors that's what they look like
well i really don't know too much else about it
the Broncos oh yuck i hate them
right or what you've heard on TV which i think is just outrageous i i don't agree with how the uh media handles elections
but uh we've gotten pretty good at it we've been doing it a couple of years now
uh uh not realizing the way you change it is to vote
loves that's right loves the little dog loves to travel of course she's dead asleep before we get to the end of the block and she never you know she sleeps the whole time but she loves to travel
yeah i think i was the one who did that actually
no in fact in fact the Cowboys got the best end of that deal
that's not too bad
so there's more of them getting killed than the Whites
i don't know Frisco there always seemed to be a lot of drugs in Frisco for as small a town as it was there were a lot of drugs
and they make more money if you extend your loan
oh how nice no he doesn't have one of those so
almost every day i uh this spring has been uh a little hard to keep up the pace because uh we've had a lot of family activities my wife has taken up skiing
i know i'm trying to think if there's anything i do you like uh i like stuff that's on Great Performances and i we used to watch mystery quite quite a bit and enjoyed that
hum boy that makes the governor's vote a whole lot more important doesn't it
i heard roses i heard that roses are really difficult to grow and they really take a lot of
that's right and and i don't know i i think that i i think i think the Federal government is going to more or less leave it alone i think they've got i think there are more pressing problems
and so i think um it's become real important to me that we try to spend time together as a family so there's one or two nights a week we have a on Monday nights we set aside time where it's called uh family home evening and we stay home that evening all of us and we do things together
i just can't keep and uh the jogging was never for me because my knees are not i just don't think they could stand that so
yes we uh oh yeah it's it's deader than a doornail up here we've only lived around my husband was uh transferred up here from uh
you know offset the income that they get or whatever so but you know i think if
forget who their quarterback is i can see his face
that's true that's very true um-hum
it was just so thick and uh heavy uh i couldn't believe it i because i mean i used to live in Atlanta years ago and it was always fairly clean i mean you you always you didn't have problem with stagnant air like like LA does
just forty miles north due north of Cincinnati and uh but uh northern Indiana has many tornadoes come roaring across and we get the backlash off of it if not the part of the tornado itself
see i took him and a friend to to see uh Kindergarten Cop a couple of weeks ago
uh-huh do you have one of those straight edge things to put underneath when you're doing the baseboards
i see right exactly exactly
and a pool to go to that would be nice
so the you know just for the doesn't really work out for us too economical to pay twenty dollars for a one way bus ride for these two kids but some days we have to do it some days it just works out to where i don't get into work early enough to get off
yeah oh that's okay
yep i'm ready for a new car myself but i've had this car for eleven years and it's given me such little trouble that i i i don't think i could get an adequate replacement that would uh cause me to let huh
i think they have a really good um quality
and put it in front of the Wal-Mart store in town and they they it just really every every every time you went by there it was just over flowing
well you know TI you know TI offers some good stuff and then i think there's i mean i think there's some negatives but there's going to be some negatives anywhere you know no matter where you go i have you know all this is the first really large company i've worked for i've always been involved in little small you know individual privately owned  owned firms and so i've never had the the big benefit package so i really don't know how to compare it to other big companies you know it when i came on it was great see because i had never had anything even close to what what they offered so i've been real pleased
it might not make the other person feel like you were really wanting to be there yeah
oh that's great that really is good
uh and and you know some people might not believe that but uh but i do
sure and that's that's held in by two bolts and a bracket and a plug of wire in the bottom of it no
yeah i agree i agree i think it also gives a woman a chance to if she does have a job a nd a career it gives the man and the wife both a chance to both be working and maybe save up some money and then it gives her a little more option if she wants to stay home with the children while they're young
oh i would imagine helping them feel good about themselves they're at a bad stage anyway and then to have to deal with sexual abuse would be terrible as a teen
and then the at the numbers they they're kind of outlined and stuff it it was quite bit of work but you know it was a lot of fun too i really like doing stuff like that so
well you're you're able to you're able to uh vote and go to war and things like that so
yeah i'm in North Carolina
yeah it does Um i didn't know what i wanted to do after i got my my degree um originally i had planned
oh well no uh it  i think that's a really bad plan in your budgeting if you have to pay one card off with another oh eventually eventually
and so i hit there at seven o'clock in the morning get in a half hour swim and still make it to work on time
yeah we we have a we have a dog and that's just about as bad as a kid
we're really on to that that the masking is you have to do that very very carefully
yeah it'd seem like they'd want to just to uh get some shade and keep their houses a little bit cooler in the summer
it was like i was sitting on the edge of my chair you know going oh no no and one uh i can't remember it was about uh it was right close to when we was going to find out if we was going to get to be in the play-offs or not
we had the mom the dad and one of the puppies and it was horrendous
and then i would do them like two times a day but i don't do any of that kind of stuff anymore i think having children everything just kind of everything goes by the wayside
oh yeah yeah that's  matter fact that's one of my favorite hobbies is uh reading
i said i'm losing you you're getting fade you're fading out
that's another big fat one
it sure is and i think here at TI we get what is it nine or ten
God that's great uh no i'm a native Texan
he's a very good athlete that is true uh-huh yeah Philadelphia expected to do a little better this past year unfortunately they uh they got cut a little short
but i used to work for a power company so it was very important that they make sure their employees especially linemen
yeah uh my little prize is the little Himalayan Persian it's uh you know what a himmy a himmy is
so you know realistically you know we had we really had to start we have to start recycling in some some uh geographic areas it's really tough
i've uh changed wiper wiper blades or something but i have noticed since uh i got married that my husband he hates to do auto repairs but he would rather do them himself than than to pay someone else i guess he can't make himself pay someone to do the repairs when he knows he knows how to do it and to do it so he he hates the time that he takes but he has changed um the brakes and he has done all of the tune-ups and the things like that  and recently he changed the steering mechanism in our car
uh-huh uh-huh it seems uh sometimes it seems uh rather i guess rather uh odd that one person would have that deciding factor he would be the sole factor uh determining a person's outcome i guess though but the jury still has their input and maybe he goes uh has a lot to decide has to decide a lot from what the jury has input to the case too
yeah that's right that's right i know
oh i guess all the factors that drive one to do that are appearance or general health or some some need for reduction of weight or whatever
well well in our area we just introduced the um citywide uh Clean King Sport campaign and we have a recycling mascot called Kleanaroo he's a kangaroo and um we're setting up curbside recycling bins for the city home owners and several of our local businesses also have recycling stations set up in their parking lots
it got it got real rough
and yes well right outside in uh Falls Church Virginia
yeah it's all politics
reminds me of something i read in an Isaac Asimov science fiction thing one time uh-huh
just go in and say oh i want to be a juror i can spot a guilty person a mile away
yeah well that's good everybody needs some sense of responsibility
uh my husbands fifty five and i'm a couple of years older well he's fifty seven i'm a couple years older than that time goes by
yes Cuba's really close but uh Puerto Rica is uh is it's like uh i live in Vermont from Vermont to Florida it's another another uh what fourteen hundred miles across the ocean
and decided he'd had enough of it
oh the music in that was fantastic
i've got a nine month old and i'm four months pregnant with my second and so at the time walking seems to be the best it's something i can do with her plus um doesn't tax me too physically
if it's winding down or what finding a taker
well uh you know the only person i've ever known that had a hole in one was my brother-in-law but uh and he he said he got his luckily so i don't know that's that's but i mean
most of the folk i've talked to are are industrial people that like my self that have been in the work work force for a number of years and and it's ah it's refreshing to talk to ah to some of you younger folks and get your ideas and thing you know and see how you feel about things
and they're real happy with one another and she says things like  i'm really glad when he comes home and there's not enough time to spend with him in the evening and  i'm like
last night we went out and people we were with she uh had fajitas and she had this pepper on the plate and maybe she thought it was a sweet pepper but  it wasn't and she ate it and i was wondering why her eyes were watering
and they never told us why these two people had such a vendetta against each other and the crime was uh uh attempt to commit murder you know and
i guess you keep those things you grew up with i worked in uh Missouri for a while and uh i was probably the only one in the room several times when we were watching football on TV when the Cowboys were playing the Saint Louis Cardinals and i was rooting for the Cowboys
um living in Arizona but and cruise control and tinted windows that's about it  i mean it's got to have those things otherwise i don't care
well no actually and i was until i was eight i lived in in in south uh western Georgia and then we moved over into central part of Alabama
uh yeah instead of something greasy or
i can't i i again i can't make any predictions about them but i suspect they'll go uh they'll go far
yeah The World According to Garp he wasn't always funny in that show was he
with the with the programs that are out there now
but as far as being able to really leave anything
yeah i guess it would be
do you think that's the main reason do you think the
well the paint paint job yeah if you're going to look a new car what would you look at
the subject is how we feel about immigration
and it's pretty nice especially during the Summer it keeps everything wet instead of wilting
no i mean they had a nice stereo they listen to stereo they were into Michael Jackson
but i think that's great about TI and also uh to get off the clothing the smokers you know how they have the the different designated areas for smokers and stuff i think that's great
but uh at least there isn't at least  i feel like i got rid of something
uh-huh and perhaps Emily will when she's a little older
well it's not like leaving home when you take it with you the whole idea is to get away from it
uh-huh you're that's that's that's strange because ours all of their money goes in savings if they need something we buy it for them
and it's kind of almost expected of you anyway people kind of look down on on a you know the role of a woman as a housewife it's kind of like oh well you know she didn't go to college and she's just a housewife and that's all she does right
well i think we've made it
that's right that's why now that works if you can find somebody to do it with but it's very rare that you can find somebody to do it with
well have you done much camping up in Kentucky and and those parts in the mountains
well they said that women like the the you know executive women or women that work whatever they spend uh five hundred dollars on clothes a year so but but for me
yeah yeah i have a nephew he's a little brat
they're uh they almost have what i would call a killer bee killer bee instinct
anybody who plays the 49ers really
um regarding health care it's funny because i have a sister who lives in Europe and in Europe that's the way it is health care is just
yeah i have two plots one's ten by ten and one's like fifteen by four it's a long skinny one and
right yeah it is right and i do
those type of people now i i have no pity for them
and uh everybody everybody that is unlucky enough has to do the military service
and and it happens then and i i uh uh you you know my uh uh oldest daughter's fiance is a uh is a part part he's a college professor but he also is a reserve police officer and and he uh he has all kinds of guns and he's taken her out to teach her to shoot
uh-hu h that's what i i was impressed with how much documenting he does
i don't know and uh i hadn't really wanted to get that many you know to put out there i i much prefer flowers
um uh well  give me your first impressions
house that we bought so i'm not doesn't seem like it um i mean i know so much has changed in their technology in the last few years
right oh Neil Sperry hasn't been pushing that real hard and heavy here lately
you know they've got all kinds of automatic weapons these criminals do
oh yeah i can remember at one time the the uh secretaries actually had to be artists and  and technicians and today uh with the laser printer
oh it it would be wonderful
i haven't noticed it mostly being yeah well i mean well on General Motors cars it was all metric i use my metrics essentially when i work on the cars i don't well i guess uh in changing the oil i guess that's uh i don't even know a nine sixteenths or something like that i don't even remember
well you know knowing a little bit about programming and a little bit about the time system and the way it was before and everything i just could see where he could made it so much better you know just by a few little more
right do you have the Discover card
i tell you getting back to the benefits
and it's real hard to pry money out of him to to to do these things but i was i was able to convince him that it would be cost effective and that our board presentations would be much better and
and that is yeah he's a little yeah he's anyway and that was just
uh just in you know far far out weigh the
so i don't know well i do too and you know i know people argue that that's really not a deterrent and people don't think about that but i've i've got to believe that
now that has been something i think is really neat the mall actually opens an hour and a half earlier than the stores
it's fine for my size yard but uh it really doesn't have the power of a gas motor
you took my favorite program off the air and do you do you think it'll ever be back and they said no we don't think it will be well that was channel eleven and now it's on channel four
so yeah i hear a lot of horror stories about things like that but most of the time it's
so do y'all have can banks
how we're living socially in comparison to maybe from that time period from ten twenty or whatever you remember it to be
that'd probably be pretty interesting i was summoned down to the courthouse last week they had summoned eight hundred people about four hundred showed up and it was for a murder trial
i i hadn't been anywhere where the weather was so tremendously great for me
uh not if it's done fairly and that's probably my question is how how do you know it's done fairly
um-hum yeah that's true um-hum that's right i yeah i think i think this was this was a very interesting topic
and in a case like that uh where well you've got  a moral problem and an economic one uh
well um i'm not uh much of a a woodworker myself but my dad owns a shop and he uh makes quite a few uh arts and crafts just type things out of wood and um
oh  that's that's one of the worse things about it it really is but uh you know
um-hum i bet that would be rather interesting uh that's uh self-improvement that's that's always well that's that's kind of a hobby but it is self-improvement uh from the standpoint of probably relaxing um
virtually anyone any hacker being able to know what your income is what your spending habits are and you know and and that hacker just has to get into in touch with a sneak thief and suddenly and then what started as an invasion of privacy can be you know an invasion of your actual home
oh so you think it was fear that kept Iraq from using it but yet the
he pays for that yeah a couple hundred bucks probably for that like high end card
and i try to uh you know try something else you know something with a little more vegetables or something but yeah i was the same way but we haven't really eaten Chinese that much since we've been in uh Texas it's funny
and and the Dodgers i guess what surprised me most about the Dodgers was letting uh Valenzuela go
it costs twenty five thousand dollars per inmate per year just to keep them locked up that doesn't count any medical or dental health they get
and i got down to where i uh to to the building i was going to and my face was about frozen off and i thought was that such a good choice i weren't quite so sure at that point
uh-huh you had company
but see right right now we're having a hard time finding people jobs
huh now in some of the towns around us they're already picking up the newspapers
yeah italian accent yeah yeah it's it's about a movie about you know this guy who was running a a movie
well i i had uh when i moved in i did not have my garage built and my breezeway and the concrete stairs upstairs the stairs the stairs were were made out of wood and the reason i did that it was getting late in November and the winter was coming
and i'm not lucky enough to just go ahead and break it you know the things got to get fractured so that it never heals properly
but you have sponsored balloons you know like companies like Coors
yeah i never lived anywhere near Los Angeles
so how many years you been up there
and um the there is men and also women women aren't um nearly as frequent and also that have elderly couples once their kids have left that can volunteer to go on a mission and um they're all over the world and its it is an incredible logistics i mean they have a training center where they teach them it's called the Missionary Training Center in Utah and they have to be taught the language
yeah it's it's i i i find it very strange um more people you know real Met fans don't like the Yankees and real Yankee fans don't like the Mets for some reason
who did you root for in the Super Bowl
fall short of of being really creative with a lot of things i mean here's the situation of this kid at home you know it's a classic slapstick situation with these bungling burglars trying to get in
well there are other benefits with the military
