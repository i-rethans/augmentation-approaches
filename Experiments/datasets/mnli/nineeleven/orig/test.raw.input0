But while the effort failed, it shows what Bin Ladin and his associates hoped to do.
By 8:00 A.M. on the morning of Tuesday, September 11,2001, they had defeated all the security layers that America's civil aviation security system then had in place to prevent a hijacking.
Third, no middle ground exists in what Qutb conceived as a struggle between God and Satan.

The line to the White House shelter conference room-and the Vice President- kept cutting off.
We found no evidence that, at this critical time, NORAD's top commanders, in Florida or Cheyenne Mountain, coordinated with their counterparts at FAA headquarters to improve awareness and organize a common response.
Outraged, several Libyan members of al Qaeda and the Islamic Army Shura renounced all connections with him.
The Vice President was logged calling the President at 10:18 for a twominute conversation that obtained the confirmation.

After being in and out of Egyptian prisons during the 1980s, Abdel Rahman found refuge in the United States.
The Vice President was wondering how the hell could a plane hit the World Trade Center when he saw the second aircraft strike the South Tower.

 Is this real-world or exercise?
joint facility in Riyadh for training the Saudi National Guard.
But another aircraft was heading toward Washington, an aircraft about which NORAD had heard  United 93.
They assumed the fighter escort would be discreet, vectored to a position five miles directly behind the hijacked aircraft, where it could perform its mission to monitor the aircraft's flight path.

The flight attendant reported that the flight had been hijacked, both pilots had been killed, a flight attendant had been stabbed, and the hijackers were probably flying the plane.
At 9:58:57, Jarrah told another hijacker in the cockpit to block the door.
The controller tracking American 77 told us he noticed the aircraft turning to the southwest, and then saw the data disappear.
While it apparently was not heard by the passengers, this announcement, like those on Flight 11 and Flight 77, was intended to deceive them.
American 77 was then 5 miles west-southwest of the Pentagon and began a 330-degree turn.
It was passed from here through the [operations] center at the White House, from the [shelter].
Bin Ladin was prepared to pick up where he had left off in Sudan.
And in this network, Bin Ladin's agenda stood out.
This is New York Center.
Or the flight attendants may just have been in their way.
About this time, Card, the lead Secret Service agent, the President's military aide, and the pilot were conferring on a possible destination for Air Force One.
Inside the NMCC, the deputy director for operations called for an allpurpose significant event conference.
Prior to 9/11, it was understood that an order to shoot down a commercial aircraft would have to be issued by the National Command Authority (a phrase used to describe the president and secretary of defense).

Bin Ladin apparently kept his options open, maintaining contacts with Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, who, though an Islamic extremist, was also one of the Taliban's most militant opponents.
That aircraft was United 93.
At 7:15, a pair of them, Khalid al Mihdhar and Majed Moqed, checked in at the American Airlines ticket counter for Flight 77, bound for Los Angeles.
At 9:58:57, Jarrah told another hijacker in the cockpit to block the door.
They knew American 77 was lost.
Though novel for its open endorsement of indiscriminate killing, Bin Ladin's 1998 declaration was only the latest in the long series of his public and private calls since 1992 that singled out the United States for attack.
This could be a third aircraft.
Jarrah's objective was to crash his airliner into symbols of the American Republic, the Capitol or the White House.
He tried the radios, first calling the aircraft directly, then the airline.
All on board, as well as many civilian and military personnel in the building, were killed.
All five hijackers passed through the Main Terminal's west security screening checkpoint; United Airlines, which was the responsible air carrier, had contracted out the work to Argenbright Security.
The New York Center controller and manager were unaware that American 11 had already crashed.
He spoke of the suffering of the Iraqi people as a result of sanctions imposed after the Gulf War, and he protested U.S. support of Israel.
No evidence of firearms or of their identifiable remains was found at the aircraft's crash site, and the cockpit voice recorder gives no indication of a gun being fired or mentioned at any time.
In fact, not only was the scramble prompted by the mistaken information about American 11, but NEADS never received notice that American 77 was hijacked.
The checkpoint featured closed-circuit television that recorded all passengers, including the hijackers, as they were screened.
The White House requested (1) the implementation of continuity of government measures, (2) fighter escorts for Air Force One, and (3) a fighter combat air patrol over Washington, D.C.
By the 1990s, high birthrates and declining rates of infant mortality had produced a common problem throughout the Muslim  a large, steadily increasing population of young men without any reasonable expectation of suitable or steady employment-a sure prescription for social turbulence.
NORAD officials have maintained consistently that had the passengers not caused United 93 to crash, the military would have prevented it from reaching Washington, D.C.
Five minutes later, the Command Center forwarded this update to  Command  O.K.
Far more acquired valuable skills but lived in stagnant economies that could not generate satisfying jobs.
He said he had not heard any prior discussion on the subject with the President.
More importantly, these state-centered regimes placed their highest priority on preserving the elite's grip on national wealth.
Everything will be okay.
 OK, let me ask the question here.

The controller tracking American 77 told us he noticed the aircraft turning to the southwest, and then saw the data disappear.
In the apt description of one witness, It drops below the radar screen and it's just continually hovering in your imagination; you don't know where it is or what happens to it.
In the apt description of one witness, It drops below the radar screen and it's just continually hovering in your imagination; you don't know where it is or what happens to it.
At least some FAA officials in Boston Center and the New England Region knew that a hijacker on board American 11 had said we have some planes.
Cleveland even told the Command Center it was prepared to contact a nearby military base to make the request.
Congress killed the idea.
Shortly after the first call, Barbara Olson reached her husband again.
He was ready to strike at the head of the snake.
The first of the Andrews fighters was airborne at 10:38.
It was led by Ali Mohamed, a former Egyptian army officer who had moved to the United States in the mid-1980s, enlisted in the U.S.
 It sounds like, we're talking to New York, that there's another one aimed at the World Trade Center.
At least some FAA officials in Boston Center and the New England Region knew that a hijacker on board American 11 had said we have some planes.
The Command Center executed the request and, a minute later, Cleveland Center reported that United 93 may have a bomb on board.
Lower-level officials improvised-for example, the FAA's Boston Center bypassed the chain of command and directly contacted NEADS after the first hijacking.
Push them back.
The President told us his instinct was to project calm, not to have the country see an excited reaction at a moment of crisis.
On Flight 93, however, the takeover took place 46 minutes after takeoff and there were only four hijackers.
Allah is the greatest!
The outcome left Bin Ladin indisputably in charge of what remained of the MAK and al Qaeda.
It was passed from here through the [operations] center at the White House, from the [shelter].
Three months later, when interviewed in Afghanistan by ABC-TV, Bin Ladin enlarged on these themes.
This lesson was applied, using Tomahawk missiles, early in the Clinton administration.
NORAD, what's the situation?
Saudi Arabia and the United States supplied billions of dollars worth of secret assistance to rebel groups in Afghanistan fighting the Soviet occupation.
No evidence of firearms or of their identifiable remains was found at the aircraft's crash site, and the cockpit voice recorder gives no indication of a gun being fired or mentioned at any time.
The passengers continued their assault and at 10:02:23, a hijacker said, Pull it down!
At 9:37:46, American Airlines Flight 77 crashed into the Pentagon, traveling at approximately 530 miles per hour.
However, the simultaneous loss of radio and transponder signal would be a rare and alarming occurrence, and would normally indicate a catastrophic system failure or an aircraft crash.
Bin Ladin shares Qutb's stark view, permitting him and his followers to rationalize even unprovoked mass murder as righteous defense of an embattled faith.
 Is this real-world or exercise?
Five seconds later, Jarrah asked, Is that it?
It is the story of eccentric and violent ideas sprouting in the fertile ground of political and social turmoil.
Jarrah stopped the violent maneuvers at about 10:01:00 and said,Allah is the greatest!
We are returning to the airport.
Furthermore, the repression and isolation of women in many Muslim countries have not only seriously limited individual opportunity but also crippled overall economic productivity.
. . . You got a conflict on that direction?
In Sudan, he established an Islamic Army Shura that was to serve as the coordinating body for the consortium of terrorist groups with which he was forging alliances.
Representatives also came from organizations such as the Palestine Liberation Organization, Hamas, and Hezbollah.
These measures were precautionary steps taken because of the strikes in New York.
The cockpit voice recorder captured the sounds of the passenger assault muffled by the intervening cockpit door.
They could not recall that any of the passengers they screened were CAPPS selectees.
They initiated their cockpit takeover within 30 minutes of takeoff.
The heading of the Langley fighters was adjusted to send them to the Baltimore area.
They were planning to hijack these planes and turn them into large guided missiles, loaded with up to 11,400 gallons of jet fuel.
It was led by Ali Mohamed, a former Egyptian army officer who had moved to the United States in the mid-1980s, enlisted in the U.S.
Bin Ladin flew on a leased aircraft from Khartoum to Jalalabad, with a refueling stopover in the United Arab Emirates.
When we quote from a source document, we use its transliteration, e.g.,al Qida instead of al Qaeda.
From the airplane or from the ground?
Thirty-seven passengers, including the hijackers, boarded the plane.
Bin Ladin now had a vision of himself as head of an international jihad confederation.
 That was another-it was evidently another aircraft that hit the tower.
They are thus a ready audience for calls to Muslims to purify their society, reject unwelcome modernization, and adhere strictly to the Sharia.
A manager at the Herndon Command Center asked FAA headquarters if they wanted to order a nationwide ground stop.
The Operations Center located at FAA headquarters receives notifications of incidents, including accidents and hijackings.
The history, culture, and body of beliefs from which Bin Ladin has shaped and spread his message are largely unknown to many Americans.
Sir, they're going to want to know what to do.
Another passenger told her they were traveling northeast.
The controller continued to try to contact United 93, and asked whether the pilot could confirm that he had been hijacked.
The Vice President authorized fighter aircraft to engage the inbound plane.
In the United States, NORAD is divided into three sectors.
He became even more concerned as its route changed, moving into another sector's airspace.
Shortly after the first call, Barbara Olson reached her husband again.
One senior FAA air traffic control manager said that it was simply not the FAA's place to order the airlines what to tell their pilots.
They knew American 77 was lost.
Second, he warned that more people, including Muslims, were attracted to jahiliyya and its material comforts than to his view of Islam; jahiliyya could therefore triumph over Islam.
You know you look down and see the Pentagon burning and I thought the bastards snuck one by us.
After being in and out of Egyptian prisons during the 1980s, Abdel Rahman found refuge in the United States.
President Reagan quickly withdrew U.S. forces from Lebanon-a reversal later routinely cited by jihadists as evidence of U.S. weakness.
Three minutes later, Sweeney was reconnected to the office and began relaying updates to the manager, Michael Woodward.
The mission crew commander explained to us that the purpose was to position the Langley fighters between the reported southbound American 11 and the nation's capital.
Three of the flights had actually taken off within 10 to 15 minutes of their planned departure times.
We have found no evidence indicating that one of the hijackers, or anyone else, sat there on this flight.
This startling news prompted the mission crew commander at NEADS to take immediate control of the airspace to clear a flight path for the Langley Okay, we're going to turn it . . . crank it up.
to which the other replied,Yes, put it in it, and pull it down.
The flight attendants would have begun their cabin service.
The emergency call lasted approximately 25 minutes, as Ong calmly and professionally relayed information about events taking place aboard the airplane to authorities on the ground.
The Command Center told Cleveland that FAA personnel well above them in the chain of command had to make the decision to seek military assistance and were working on the issue.
The President emphasized to us that he had authorized the shootdown of hijacked aircraft.
Further, there is no universally accepted way to transliterate Arabic words and names into English.
The Herndon Command Center immediately established a teleconference between Boston, New York, and Cleveland Centers so that Boston Center could help the others understand what was happening.
The idea of a domestic command for homeland defense began to be discussed in 1997, and in 1999 the Joint Chiefs developed a concept for the establishment of a domestic Unified Command.
The details of what happened on the morning of September 11 are complex, but they play out a simple theme.
 No, he is a hijack.
By 8:33, it had reached its assigned cruising altitude of 31,000 feet.
The Command Center executed the request and, a minute later, Cleveland Center reported that United 93 may have a bomb on board.
Both individuals agreed that the teleconference played no role in coordinating a response to the attacks of 9/11.
From 9:34 to 10:08, a Command Center facility manager provided frequent updates to Acting Deputy Administrator Monte Belger and other executives at FAA headquarters as United 93 headed toward Washington, D.C.
 No, he is a hijack.
It's a faith that has made brothers and sisters of every race.
Those accounts had the effect of deflecting questions about the military's capacity to obtain timely and accurate information from its own sources.
She further indicated that the hijackers were not aware of her phone call, and that they had put all the passengers in the back of the plane.
He was rebuffed, and the Saudis joined the U.S.-led coalition.
The airlines bore responsibility, too.
Believing they had only a minute or two, the Vice President again communicated the authorization to engage or take out the aircraft.
He could stand as a symbol of resistance-above all, resistance to the West and to America.
At 8:34, the Boston Center controller received a third transmission from American 11:
The Command Center and FAA headquarters watched it too.
American 77 traveled undetected for 36 minutes on a course heading due east for Washington, D.C.
The inaccurate accounts created the impression that the Langley scramble was a logical response to an actual hijacked aircraft.
Concerns over the safety of other aircraft began to mount.
The threat of terrorists hijacking commercial airliners within the United States-and using them as guided missiles-was not recognized by NORAD before 9/11.
In Algeria, where in 1991 Islamists seemed almost certain to win power through the ballot box, the military preempted their victory, triggering a brutal civil war that continues today.
Boston Center asked the Herndon Command Center to issue a similar cockpit security alert nationwide.
It is appropriate, therefore, to reconsider whether United 93 would have been intercepted.
Inside the National Military Command Center, the deputy director of operations and his assistant began notifying senior Pentagon officials of the incident.
On 9/11, all the hijacked aircraft were in NORAD's Northeast Air Defense Sector (also known as NEADS), which is based in Rome, New York.
Islam is divided into two main branches, Sunni and Shia.
In sum, the protocols in place on 9/11 for the FAA and NORAD to respond to a hijacking presumed that
How did Bin Ladin-with his call for the indiscriminate killing of Americans-win thousands of followers and some degree of approval from millions more?
At 9:03, they would see another aircraft strike the World Trade Center.
The Command Center and FAA headquarters watched it too.
General Wherley translated this in military terms to flying weapons free-that is, the decision to shoot rests in the cockpit, or in this case in the cockpit of the lead pilot.
5 million, which did not deter Bin Ladin.
The Vice Chairman joined the conference shortly before 10:00; the Secretary, shortly before 10:30.
At 9:34, the Command Center relayed the information concerning United 93 to FAA headquarters.
About this same time Sweeney reported to Woodward, Something is wrong.
However, it was seen at the time as a success.
Bin Ladin's grievance with the United States may have started in reaction to specific U.S. policies but it quickly became far deeper.
I'll pass that along over here.
Qutb argued that humans can choose only between Islam and jahiliyya.
The line to the White House shelter conference room-and the Vice President- kept cutting off.
They were armed and under NORAD's control.
The flight had taken off just as American 11 was being hijacked, and at 8:42 the United 175 flight crew completed their report on a suspicious transmission overheard from another plane (which turned out to have been Flight 11) just after takeoff.
Third, no middle ground exists in what Qutb conceived as a struggle between God and Satan.
Jarrah, like Atta earlier, may have inadvertently broadcast the message because he did not know how to operate the radio and the intercom.
Within seconds, the Command Center received a visual report from another aircraft, and informed headquarters that the aircraft was 20 miles northwest of Johnstown.
And, pursuant to the President's instructions I gave authorization for them to be taken out.
Though novel for its open endorsement of indiscriminate killing, Bin Ladin's 1998 declaration was only the latest in the long series of his public and private calls since 1992 that singled out the United States for attack.
The President apparently spoke to Secretary Rumsfeld for the first time that morning shortly after 10:00.
This statement was also incorrect.
No move was made to evacuate the Vice President at this time.
Each center thus had part of the knowledge of what was going on across the system.
While this was being discussed by executives at FAA headquarters, the Command Center ordered one at 9:25.
Another passenger told her they were traveling northeast.
At 9:36, the FAA's Boston Center called NEADS and relayed the discovery about an unidentified aircraft closing in on Latest report.
At 8:21, American 11 turned off its transponder, immediately degrading the information available about the aircraft.
But after September 1996, when first Jalalabad and then Kabul fell to the Taliban, Bin Ladin cemented his ties with them.
 We're just, we just we don't know who he is.
She recalled first telling the President it was a twin-engine aircraft-and then a commercial aircraft-that had struck the World Trade Center, adding that's all we know right now, Mr. President.
The Vice President again said yes.
It is far better for anyone to kill a single American soldier than to squander his efforts on other activities, he said.
The second radio transmission, 35 seconds later, indicated that the fight was continuing.
He notified his supervisor, who passed the notice up the chain of command.
As the Soviets began their withdrawal, the jihad's leaders debated what to do next.
Bin Ladin apparently kept his options open, maintaining contacts with Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, who, though an Islamic extremist, was also one of the Taliban's most militant opponents.
This organization's structure included as its operating arms an intelligence component, a military committee, a financial committee, a political committee, and a committee in charge of media affairs and propaganda.
 I'm going to try to confirm an ID for you, but I would assume he's somewhere over, uh, either New Jersey or somewhere further south.
The flight did not respond.
The Herndon Command Center immediately established a teleconference between Boston, New York, and Cleveland Centers so that Boston Center could help the others understand what was happening.
Azzam, by contrast, favored continuing to fight in Afghanistan until it had a true Islamist government.
The first President Bush had authorized the use of U.S. military forces to ensure humanitarian relief in war-torn Somalia.
While it apparently was not heard by the passengers, this announcement, like those on Flight 11 and Flight 77, was intended to deceive them.
During his entire time in Sudan, he had maintained guesthouses and training camps in Pakistan and Afghanistan.
In the apt description of one witness, It drops below the radar screen and it's just continually hovering in your imagination; you don't know where it is or what happens to it.
At 9:32, a hijacker, probably Jarrah, made or attempted to make the following announcement to the passengers of Flight 93:Ladies and  Here the captain, please sit down keep remaining sitting.

Jarrah was in seat 1B, closest to the cockpit; Nami was in 3C, Ghamdi in 3D, and Haznawi in 6B.
He then discovered, to his surprise, that the Langley fighters were not headed north toward the Baltimore area as instructed, but east over the ocean.
Once inside, Vice President Cheney and the agents paused in an area of the tunnel that had a secure phone, a bench, and television.
NEADS decided to keep the Otis fighters over New York.
At 7:18, Mihdhar and Moqed entered the security checkpoint.
Second, he warned that more people, including Muslims, were attracted to jahiliyya and its material comforts than to his view of Islam; jahiliyya could therefore triumph over Islam.
He learned in the tunnel that the Pentagon had been hit, and he saw television coverage of smoke coming from the building.
At 9:21, NEADS received a report from the   Military, Boston Center.
They claimed they had a bomb.
South Asia had an indigenous form of Islamic fundamentalism, which had developed in the nineteenth century at a school in the Indian village of Deoband.
At the end of 1979, the Soviet government sent in military units to ensure that the country would remain securely under Moscow's influence.
That's best thing, that's the best play right now.
At the same time, the Sudanese regime began to change.
The reasons are technical, arising from the way the software processed radar information, as well as from poor primary radar coverage where American 77 was flying.
The hijacking began between 8:51 and 8:54.
At 9:32, a third radio transmission came over the Keep remaining sitting.
They're moving everybody out of the way.
 Yeah, he's down.
At 7:15, a pair of them, Khalid al Mihdhar and Majed Moqed, checked in at the American Airlines ticket counter for Flight 77, bound for Los Angeles.
Al Qaeda's role in organizing terrorist operations had also changed.
This was United 175's last communication with the ground.
We are going back to the airport.
Exercises were conducted to counter this threat, but they were not based on actual intelligence.
And I'm gonna take the fighters from Otis, try to chase this guy down if I can find him.
Before 9/11, it was not unheard of for a commercial aircraft to deviate slightly from its course, or for an FAA controller to lose radio contact with a pilot for a short period of time.
Bin Ladin had an important part in this activity.
 I got somebody who keeps coasting but it looks like he's going into one of the small airports down there.
The duty officer replied that security personnel at headquarters had just begun discussing the apparent hijack on a conference call with the New England regional office.
There was confusion at that moment in the FAA.
. . . You got a conflict on that direction?
American Airlines dispatchers also tried, without success.
It carried its full capacity of nine flight attendants.
Not long afterward, senior al Qaeda operatives and trainers traveled to Iran to receive training in explosives.
We do not have to differentiate between military or civilian.
The Taliban leader Mullah Omar promptly invited Bin Ladin to move to Kandahar, ostensibly in the interests of Bin Ladin's own security but more likely to situate him where he might be easier to control.
 Yes, I understand.
At 9:03:11, United Airlines Flight 175 struck the South Tower of the World Trade Center.
5 million, which did not deter Bin Ladin.
He An air attack against North America may be in progress.
In their testimony and in other public accounts, NORAD officials also stated that the Langley fighters were scrambled to respond to the notifications about American 77,178 United 93, or both.
The controller knew American 11 was hijacked; he was focused on searching for it after the aircraft disappeared at 8:46.
He could have learned of this from messages being sent by United Airlines to the cockpits of its transcontinental flights, including Flight 93, warning of cockpit intrusion and telling of the New York attacks.
Another commercial aircraft in the vicinity then radioed in with reports over the radio of a commuter plane hitting the World Trade Center.
Thus, while the fighter pilots under NORAD direction who had scrambled out of Langley never received any type of engagement order, the Andrews pilots were operating weapons free-a permissive rule of engagement.
In 1986, a bomb went off at a disco in Berlin, killing two American soldiers.
At 9:37:46, American Airlines Flight 77 crashed into the Pentagon, traveling at approximately 530 miles per hour.
Al Qaeda helped Jemaah Islamiya (JI), a nascent organization headed by Indonesian Islamists with cells scattered across Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, and the Philippines.
And in this network, Bin Ladin's agenda stood out.
He found lodgings with Younis Khalis, the head of one of the main mujahideen factions.
Al Qaeda also used the Afghan state-owned Ariana Airlines to courier money into the country.
Salem al Hazmi cleared the metal detector and was permitted through; Nawaf al Hazmi set off the alarms for both the first and second metal detectors and was then hand-wanded before being passed.
Mihdhar did not trigger the alarm and was permitted through the checkpoint.
The FAA cleared the airspace.
By the autumn of 1993, U.S. commanders concluded that the main source of trouble was a warlord, Mohammed Farrah Aidid.
At 8:52, in Easton, Connecticut, a man named Lee Hanson received a phone call from his son Peter, a passenger on United 175.
This was the first of several occasions on 9/11 when flight attendants took action outside the scope of their training, which emphasized that in a hijacking, they were to communicate with the cockpit crew.
Few Americans had noticed it.
The groundwork for a true global terrorist network was being laid.
One scholar from the fourteenth century from whom Bin Ladin selectively quotes, Ibn Taimiyyah, condemned both corrupt rulers and the clerics who failed to criticize them.
At 8:48, while the controller was still trying to locate American 11, a New York Center manager provided the following report on a Command Center teleconference about American 11:
Al Qaeda helped Jemaah Islamiya (JI), a nascent organization headed by Indonesian Islamists with cells scattered across Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, and the Philippines.
Hani Hanjour, Khalid al Mihdhar, and Majed Moqed were flagged by CAPPS.
 It sounds like, we're talking to New York, that there's another one aimed at the World Trade Center.
But even without them, he would certainly have understood that the attacks on the World Trade Center would already have unfolded, given Flight 93's tardy departure from Newark.
Qutb argued that humans can choose only between Islam and jahiliyya.
Not until 1998 did al Qaeda undertake a major terrorist operation of its own, in large part because Bin Ladin lost his base in Sudan.
Jarrah's objective was to crash his airliner into symbols of the American Republic, the Capitol or the White House.
At 9:32, a hijacker, probably Jarrah, made or attempted to make the following announcement to the passengers of Flight 93:Ladies and  Here the captain, please sit down keep remaining sitting.
However, the simultaneous loss of radio and transponder signal would be a rare and alarming occurrence, and would normally indicate a catastrophic system failure or an aircraft crash.
His primary concern was ensuring that the pilots had a clear understanding of their rules of engagement.
At 9:00, American Airlines Executive Vice President Gerard Arpey learned that communications had been lost with American 77.
In August 1996, Bin Ladin had issued his own self-styled fatwa calling on Muslims to drive American soldiers out of Saudi Arabia.
He did so because one of the brothers did not have photo identification nor could he understand English, and because the agent found both of the passengers to be suspicious.
He was ready to strike at the head of the snake.
The center also contacted the West Virginia State Police and asked whether any reports of a downed aircraft had been received.
The FBI told us they found no trace of explosives at the crash sites.
The details of what happened on the morning of September 11 are complex, but they play out a simple theme.
Moreover, Bin Ladin had in fact been sponsoring anti-Saddam Islamists in Iraqi Kurdistan, and sought to attract them into his Islamic army.
The Command Center told Cleveland that FAA personnel well above them in the chain of command had to make the decision to seek military assistance and were working on the issue.
We found no evidence that, at this critical time, NORAD's top commanders, in Florida or Cheyenne Mountain, coordinated with their counterparts at FAA headquarters to improve awareness and organize a common response.
The threat of terrorists hijacking commercial airliners within the United States-and using them as guided missiles-was not recognized by NORAD before 9/11.
We have a bomb on board.
Secretary Rumsfeld told us he was just gaining situational awareness when he spoke with the Vice President at 10:39.
NEADS reported to the Continental U.S.
A total of 32 such National Guard teams were authorized by fiscal year 2001.
Two minutes later, staff reported that they were still trying to locate Secretary Rumsfeld and Vice Chairman Myers.
As early as January 1994, Bin Ladin received the surveillance reports, complete with diagrams prepared by the team's computer specialist.
Yet as political, social, and economic problems created flammable societies, Bin Ladin used Islam's most extreme, fundamentalist traditions as his match.
This was United 175's last communication with the ground.
Perhaps the terrorists stabbed the flight attendants to get a cockpit key, to force one of them to open the cockpit door, or to lure the captain or first officer out of the cockpit.
At 8:52, in Easton, Connecticut, a man named Lee Hanson received a phone call from his son Peter, a passenger on United 175.
The Vice President's military aide told us he believed the Vice President spoke to the President just after entering the conference room, but he did not hear what they said.
Some of Bin Ladin's companies ran short of funds.
In February 1996, Sudanese officials began approaching officials from the United States and other governments, asking what actions of theirs might ease foreign pressure.
Hani Hanjour, Khalid al Mihdhar, and Majed Moqed were flagged by CAPPS.
Repeatedly between 10:14 and 10:19, a lieutenant colonel at the White House relayed to the NMCC that the Vice President had confirmed fighters were cleared to engage inbound aircraft if they could verify that the aircraft was hijacked.
. . . You got a conflict on that direction?
He spoke of the suffering of the Iraqi people as a result of sanctions imposed after the Gulf War, and he protested U.S. support of Israel.
Between 9:15 and 9:30, the staff was busy arranging a return to Washington, while the President consulted his senior advisers about his remarks.
He also made use of the already-established Third World Relief Agency (TWRA) headquartered in Vienna, whose branch office locations included Zagreb and Budapest.
Yet as political, social, and economic problems created flammable societies, Bin Ladin used Islam's most extreme, fundamentalist traditions as his match.
They have what?
American also began getting identifications of the hijackers, as Ong and then Sweeney passed on some of the seat numbers of those who had gained unauthorized access to the cockpit.
It is quite possible Jarrah knew of the success of the assault on the World Trade Center.
I just had a report that American 11 is still in the air, and it's on its way towards-heading towards Washington.
During his entire time in Sudan, he had maintained guesthouses and training camps in Pakistan and Afghanistan.
This could be a third aircraft.
At least some FAA officials in Boston Center and the New England Region knew that a hijacker on board American 11 had said we have some planes.
Bin Ladin agreed to help Turabi in an ongoing war against African Christian separatists in southern Sudan and also to do some road building.
The Chairman was out of the country.
Ever since the Islamist regime came to power in Khartoum, the United States and other Western governments had pressed it to stop providing a haven for terrorist organizations.
Their actions saved the lives of countless others, and may have saved either the Capitol or the White House from destruction.
She recalled first telling the President it was a twin-engine aircraft-and then a commercial aircraft-that had struck the World Trade Center, adding that's all we know right now, Mr. President.
They initiated their cockpit takeover within 30 minutes of takeoff.
Has that directive been transmitted to the aircraft?
The idea of a domestic command for homeland defense began to be discussed in 1997, and in 1999 the Joint Chiefs developed a concept for the establishment of a domestic Unified Command.
Rice, who entered the room shortly after the Vice President and sat next to him, remembered hearing him inform the President, Sir, the CAPs are up.
In any case, on May 19, 1996, Bin Ladin left Sudan-significantly weakened, despite his ambitions and organizational skills.
He told us that by the time he arrived, the order had already been passed down NORAD's chain of command.
After consulting with NEADS command, the crew commander issued the order at 9:23:Okay . . . scramble Langley.
After the Saudis agreed to allow U.S. armed forces to be based in the Kingdom, Bin Ladin and a number of Islamic clerics began to publicly denounce the arrangement.
It is not clear how the shootdown order was communicated within NORAD.
Say again, slowly.
About this time the Fasten Seatbelt sign would usually have been turned off and the flight attendants would have begun preparing for cabin service.
At 9:39, the NMCC's deputy director for operations, a military officer, opened the call from the Pentagon, which had just been hit.
If you try to make any moves, you'll endanger yourself and the airplane.
. . . [I]f they're there then we'll run on them.
He also stresses grievances against the United States widely shared in the Muslim world.
Fifty-six passengers boarded the flight.
Bin Ladin now had a vision of himself as head of an international jihad confederation.
In public testimony before this Commission in May 2003, NORAD officials stated that at 9:16, NEADS received hijack notification of United 93 from the FAA.
At 9:44, NORAD briefed the conference on the possible hijacking of Delta 1989.
The controller checked to see if American Airlines could establish communication with American 11.
We do not believe that the true picture of that morning reflects discredit on the operational personnel at NEADS or FAA facilities.
He notified his supervisor, who passed the notice up the chain of command.
We need to talk to FAA.
Al Qaeda's role in organizing terrorist operations had also changed.
About this time, Card, the lead Secret Service agent, the President's military aide, and the pilot were conferring on a possible destination for Air Force One.
He then discovered, to his surprise, that the Langley fighters were not headed north toward the Baltimore area as instructed, but east over the ocean.
One spoke very little English and one spoke excellent English.
Bin Ladin has stated flatly,Our fight against these governments is not separate from our fight against you.
As one witness recalled, [It] was almost like there were parallel decisionmaking processes going on; one was a voice conference orchestrated by the NMCC . . . and then there was the [White House video teleconference].
The Vice President again said yes.
We have concluded, from the available evidence, that the Vice President arrived in the room shortly before 10:00, perhaps at 9:58.
They had been responding to a report about an aircraft that did not exist.
About this same time Sweeney reported to Woodward, Something is wrong.
Radar data show the Otis fighters were airborne at 8:53.
The Vice President's military aide told us he believed the Vice President spoke to the President just after entering the conference room, but he did not hear what they said.
Jarrah's objective was to crash his airliner into symbols of the American Republic, the Capitol or the White House.
Muslims believe that these revelations, given to the greatest and last of a chain of prophets stretching from Abraham through Jesus, complete God's message to humanity.
Seizing on symbols of Islam's past greatness, he promises to restore pride to people who consider themselves the victims of successive foreign masters.
Push them back.
As this exchange shows, Secretary Rumsfeld was not in the NMCC when the shootdown order was first conveyed.
In August 1996, Bin Ladin had issued his own self-styled fatwa calling on Muslims to drive American soldiers out of Saudi Arabia.
The Secret Service agent felt strongly that the situation in Washington was too unstable for the President to return there, and Card agreed.
He boarded the aircraft, asked the Secret Service about the safety of his family, and called the Vice President.
As the Soviets began their withdrawal, the jihad's leaders debated what to do next.
 United nine three, have you got information on that yet?
The cockpit voice recorder data indicate that a woman, most likely a flight attendant, was being held captive in the cockpit.
He learned in the tunnel that the Pentagon had been hit, and he saw television coverage of smoke coming from the building.
His preaching had inspired the assassination of Sadat.
We have found no evidence indicating that one of the hijackers, or anyone else, sat there on this flight.
However, it was seen at the time as a success.
The NEADS technician who took this call from the FAA immediately passed the word to the mission crew commander, who reported to the NEADS battle  Mission Crew Commander,  Okay, uh, American Airlines is still airborne.
The Department of Defense, like the Department of State, had a coordinator who represented the department on the interagency committee concerned with counterterrorism.
Bin Ladin reportedly showed particular interest in learning how to use truck bombs such as the one that had killed 241 U.S.
At the same time, these regimes had closed off nearly all paths for peaceful opposition, forcing their critics to choose silence, exile, or violent opposition.
Six feet five and thin, Bin Ladin appeared to be ungainly but was in fact quite athletic, skilled as a horseman, runner, climber, and soccer player.
No one at the FAA or the airlines that day had ever dealt with multiple hijackings.
We cannot identify whose voices can be heard.
At 9:29, the autopilot on American 77 was disengaged; the aircraft was at 7,000 feet and approximately 38 miles west of the Pentagon.
We are returning to the airport.
Indeed, it is not clear to us that the video teleconference was fully under way before 9:37, when the Pentagon was struck.
He also made use of the already-established Third World Relief Agency (TWRA) headquartered in Vienna, whose branch office locations included Zagreb and Budapest.
Al Qaeda's role in organizing terrorist operations had also changed.
After bloody struggles, the Sunni became (and remain) the majority sect.
At 8:41, Sweeney told Woodward that passengers in coach were under the impression that there was a routine medical emergency in first class.
 Yeah, he's down.
Sweeney told Woodward that she and Ong were trying to relay as much information as they could to people on the ground.
Uh, they're speculating it's from the aircraft.
That nine minutes' notice before impact was the most the military would receive of any of the four hijackings.
Intelligence clearly linked the bombing to Libya's Colonel Muammar Qadhafi.
As a key part of its efforts, Defense created National Guard WMD Civil Support Teams to respond in the event of a WMD terrorist incident.
At 7:18, Mihdhar and Moqed entered the security checkpoint.
The President told us his instinct was to project calm, not to have the country see an excited reaction at a moment of crisis.
Shortly thereafter, the passengers and flight crew began a series of calls from GTE airphones and cellular phones.
That's what they're speculating, that's speculation only.
One of the passengers who mentioned a bomb expressed his belief that it was not real.
I also had conversation with American Airlines, and they've told us that they believe that one of their stewardesses was stabbed and that there are people in the cockpit that have control of the aircraft, and that's all the information they have right now.
Believing they had only a minute or two, the Vice President again communicated the authorization to engage or take out the aircraft.
Because several passengers on United 93 described three hijackers on the plane, not four, some have wondered whether one of the hijackers had been able to use the cockpit jump seat from the outset of the flight.
Under the command of state governors, they provided support to civilian agencies to assess the nature of the attack, offer medical and technical advice, and coordinate state and local responses.
The controller only heard something unintelligible; he did not hear the specific words we have some planes.
It is far better for anyone to kill a single American soldier than to squander his efforts on other activities, he said.
This lesson was applied, using Tomahawk missiles, early in the Clinton administration.
One of the flights that received the warning was United 93.
These were part of a larger network used by diverse organizations for recruiting and training fighters for Islamic insurgencies in such places as Tajikistan, Kashmir, and Chechnya.
The President and the Vice President The President was seated in a classroom when, at 9:05, Andrew Card whispered to  A second plane hit the second tower.
At about 9:00, the senior NMCC operations officer reached out to the FAA operations center for information.
And, as a Palestinian, he saw Israel as the top priority for the next stage.
Because several passengers on United 93 described three hijackers on the plane, not four, some have wondered whether one of the hijackers had been able to use the cockpit jump seat from the outset of the flight.
American Airlines dispatchers also tried, without success.
Shall we finish it off?
Cleveland even told the Command Center it was prepared to contact a nearby military base to make the request.
In addition, they overstated the FAA's ability to provide the military with timely and useful information that morning.
This organization's structure included as its operating arms an intelligence component, a military committee, a financial committee, a political committee, and a committee in charge of media affairs and propaganda.
According to one call, they voted on whether to rush the terrorists in an attempt to retake the plane.
Any Muslim who rejects his ideas is just one more nonbeliever worthy of destruction.
On 9/11, the terrorists turned off the transponders on three of the four hijacked aircraft.
She did not display signs of panic and did not indicate any awareness of an impending crash.
Though novel for its open endorsement of indiscriminate killing, Bin Ladin's 1998 declaration was only the latest in the long series of his public and private calls since 1992 that singled out the United States for attack.
All understood the plane had been hijacked.
Not until 1998 did al Qaeda undertake a major terrorist operation of its own, in large part because Bin Ladin lost his base in Sudan.
At the same time or shortly thereafter, Atta-the only terrorist on board trained to fly a jet-would have moved to the cockpit from his business-class seat, possibly accompanied by Omari.
We're told that one aircraft is down but we do not have a pilot report that did it.
After being in and out of Egyptian prisons during the 1980s, Abdel Rahman found refuge in the United States.
He did not know that other aircraft had been hijacked.
He also stresses grievances against the United States widely shared in the Muslim world.
By the 1990s, high birthrates and declining rates of infant mortality had produced a common problem throughout the Muslim  a large, steadily increasing population of young men without any reasonable expectation of suitable or steady employment-a sure prescription for social turbulence.
We need to get the military involved with us.
If approval was given, the orders would be transmitted down NORAD's chain of command.
To our knowledge none of them had ever flown an actual airliner before.
Three of the flights had actually taken off within 10 to 15 minutes of their planned departure times.
Outraged, several Libyan members of al Qaeda and the Islamic Army Shura renounced all connections with him.
Or the flight attendants may just have been in their way.
The Operations Center located at FAA headquarters receives notifications of incidents, including accidents and hijackings.
Three months later, when interviewed in Afghanistan by ABC-TV, Bin Ladin enlarged on these themes.
Yeah, we gotta get-we gotta alert the military real quick on this.
At 9:41, Cleveland Center lost United 93's transponder signal.
Though Turabi had been its inspirational leader, General Omar al Bashir, president since 1989, had never been entirely under his thumb.
In interviews with us, NEADS personnel expressed considerable confusion over the nature and effect of the order.
Repeatedly between 10:14 and 10:19, a lieutenant colonel at the White House relayed to the NMCC that the Vice President had confirmed fighters were cleared to engage inbound aircraft if they could verify that the aircraft was hijacked.
He also lost the head of his military committee, Abu Ubaidah al Banshiri, one of the most capable and popular leaders of al Qaeda.
Okay, you read that from the Vice President, right?
'Cause we have got confirmation-  He did not land.
At 9:36, the FAA's Boston Center called NEADS and relayed the discovery about an unidentified aircraft closing in on Latest report.
In this competition for legitimacy, secular regimes had no alternative to offer.
As it turned out, the NEADS air defenders had nine minutes' notice on the first hijacked plane, no advance notice on the second, no advance notice on the third, and no advance notice on the fourth.
America is under attack.
His checked bag was screened for explosives and then loaded on the plane.
Both individuals agreed that the teleconference played no role in coordinating a response to the attacks of 9/11.
The aircraft's identity or type was unknown.
One of the flights that received the warning was United 93.
It came over the chat.
At that point, the second call was cut off.
The operation was not cost  the United States lost two planes.
Presumably FAA would have provided such information, but we do not know how long that would have taken, nor how long it would have taken NEADS to locate the target.
At 9:57, the passenger assault began.
By the autumn of 1993, U.S. commanders concluded that the main source of trouble was a warlord, Mohammed Farrah Aidid.
The history, culture, and body of beliefs from which Bin Ladin has shaped and spread his message are largely unknown to many Americans.
Because Ballinger was still responsible for his other flights as well as Flight 175, his warning message was not transmitted to Flight 93 until 9:23.
Far more acquired valuable skills but lived in stagnant economies that could not generate satisfying jobs.
The hijackers were wearing red bandanas, and they forced the passengers to the back of the aircraft.
As the lead pilot explained, I reverted to the Russian threat.
NORAD officials have maintained that they would have intercepted and shot down United 93.
The center also contacted the West Virginia State Police and asked whether any reports of a downed aircraft had been received.
If approval was given, the orders would be transmitted down NORAD's chain of command.
The aircraft was a Boeing 757 piloted by Captain Charles F. Burlingame and First Officer David Charlebois.
Bin Ladin was also willing to explore possibilities for cooperation with Iraq, even though Iraq's dictator, Saddam Hussein, had never had an Islamist agenda-save for his opportunistic pose as a defender of the faithful against Crusaders during the Gulf War of 1991.
Some maintained collaborative relationships with al Qaeda, but many disengaged entirely.
Shootdown authority was first communicated to NEADS at 10:31.
But the highest-level Defense Department officials relied on the NMCC's air threat conference, in which the FAA did not participate for the first 48 minutes.
One recipient of a call from the aircraft recounted specifically asking her caller whether the hijackers had guns.
It had been publicly declared years earlier, most notably in a declaration faxed early in 1998 to an Arabic-language newspaper in London.
The President and the Vice President indicated to us they had not been aware that fighters had been scrambled out of Andrews, at the request of the Secret Service and outside the military chain of command.
At 8:34, the Boston Center controller received a third transmission from American 11:
The Hadith, which recount Mohammed's sayings and deeds as recorded by his contemporaries, are another fundamental source.
By 8:00 A.M. on the morning of Tuesday, September 11,2001, they had defeated all the security layers that America's civil aviation security system then had in place to prevent a hijacking.
The airlines bore responsibility, too.
At 8:44, Gonzalez reported losing phone contact with Ong.
We believe such statements do not reflect an adequate appreciation of the FAA's responsibility for the safety and security of civil aviation.
Presumably FAA would have provided such information, but we do not know how long that would have taken, nor how long it would have taken NEADS to locate the target.
History and Political Context Few fundamentalist movements in the Islamic world gained lasting political power.
As one witness recalled, [It] was almost like there were parallel decisionmaking processes going on; one was a voice conference orchestrated by the NMCC . . . and then there was the [White House video teleconference].
The controller checked his radio equipment and contacted another controller at 8:53, saying that we may have a hijack and that he could not find the aircraft.
Crisis managers at the FAA and the airlines did not yet act to warn other aircraft.
Bin Ladin went initially to Jalalabad, probably because it was in an area controlled by a provincial council of Islamic leaders who were not major contenders for national power.
Bin Ladin, whose efforts in Afghanistan had earned him celebrity and respect, proposed to the Saudi monarchy that he summon mujahideen for a jihad to retake Kuwait.
But another aircraft was heading toward Washington, an aircraft about which NORAD had heard  United 93.
She further indicated that the hijackers were not aware of her phone call, and that they had put all the passengers in the back of the plane.
 Got him just out of 9,500-9,000 now.
We believe such statements do not reflect an adequate appreciation of the FAA's responsibility for the safety and security of civil aviation.
I just had a report that American 11 is still in the air, and it's on its way towards-heading towards Washington.
At 8:21, American 11 turned off its transponder, immediately degrading the information available about the aircraft.
All on board, as well as many civilian and military personnel in the building, were killed.
 Yes, I understand.
The air defense of America began with this call.
He returned to Afghanistan.
Salem al Hazmi cleared the metal detector and was permitted through; Nawaf al Hazmi set off the alarms for both the first and second metal detectors and was then hand-wanded before being passed.
Inside the NMCC, the deputy director for operations called for an allpurpose significant event conference.
They are thus a ready audience for calls to Muslims to purify their society, reject unwelcome modernization, and adhere strictly to the Sharia.
Islam is divided into two main branches, Sunni and Shia.
The NEADS technician who took this call from the FAA immediately passed the word to the mission crew commander, who reported to the NEADS battle  Mission Crew Commander,  Okay, uh, American Airlines is still airborne.
American 11 struck the NorthTower at 8:46.
The other aircraft referred to by New York Center was United 175.
While most of the group's key figures had accompanied Bin Ladin to Afghanistan, Banshiri had remained in Kenya to oversee the training and weapons shipments of the cell set up some four years earlier.
Say again, slowly.
The long, disjointed document condemned the Saudi monarchy for allowing the presence of an army of infidels in a land with the sites most sacred to Islam, and celebrated recent suicide bombings of American military facilities in the Kingdom.
It is not clear how the shootdown order was communicated within NORAD.
The international environment for Bin Ladin's efforts was ideal.
At 8:28, Boston Center called the Command Center in Herndon to advise that it believed American 11 had been hijacked and was heading toward New York Center's airspace.
In the absence of information that the crash was anything other than an accident, the White House staff monitored the news as they went ahead with their regular schedules.
Islam is a faith that brings comfort to a billion people around the world.
Two minutes later the transponder was turned off and even primary radar contact with the aircraft was lost.
Many controllers work at the FAA's 22 Air Route Traffic Control Centers.
The threat of Soviet bombers diminished significantly as the Cold War ended, and the number of NORAD alert sites was reduced from its Cold War high of 26.
Furthermore, the repression and isolation of women in many Muslim countries have not only seriously limited individual opportunity but also crippled overall economic productivity.
American 77 was then 5 miles west-southwest of the Pentagon and began a 330-degree turn.
He appointed a new financial manager, whom his followers saw as miserly.
The aircraft's identity or type was unknown.
At 10:00:03, Jarrah stabilized the airplane.
Because Ballinger was still responsible for his other flights as well as Flight 175, his warning message was not transmitted to Flight 93 until 9:23.
There is conflicting evidence about when the Vice President arrived in the shelter conference room.
The hijacking began between 8:51 and 8:54.
But after September 1996, when first Jalalabad and then Kabul fell to the Taliban, Bin Ladin cemented his ties with them.
They said the hijackers wielded knives and claimed to have a bomb.
