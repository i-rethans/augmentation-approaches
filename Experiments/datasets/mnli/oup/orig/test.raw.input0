Note that this system poses production questions for BMW similar to those faced by apparel suppliers.
Regardless of where Quick Response has succeeded, however, our research indicates that very different time-based competitive demands have emerged in the industry, driven not by voluntary acceptance of policies but by the changing nature of market competition among retailers.
In the felled seams of shirts and jeans, for example, the visible stitches might be of a color designed to decorate the garment.
In this period, a number of key technological changes  sewing machines that made many more stitches a minute, long knives instead of shears for cutting, and pressing machines.

Basic items also represent a major percentage of all apparel goods sold.
Product stock-outs accounted for 24 percent, $6 billion, of the losses, and the cost of inventory carrying itself constituted the remaining 20 percent, $5 billion.
The forecasting challenges retailers confront have been amplified in recent years by product proliferation in almost every category.
After completing the process of developing a demand forecast for each SKU, a retailer must determine how much of each item to stock on the shelves of its stores.
Therefore, it is not surprising that most replenishment products are basics or fashion-basics with relatively stable  Manufacturers are unwilling to hold speculative stock to meet replenishment requests from retailers for fashion products because the risk of holding those fashion goods in finished goods inventory is too high.
For example, increasing the number of products offered in a category by a factor of four (say from fifty items to 200) without increasing total demand in the category would increase the coefficient of variation for each individual product by a factor of two.
If a new sewing table or a new sewing machine with programmable features is added at a particular workstation'that is, any device that reduces the time it takes to complete various tasks'then the allowable time and wage rate for that operation must be changed.
In practice, however, retail inventory management is fraught with challenges, such as long and uncertain order-fulfillment lead times, and errors in product identification and record keeping.

The order must be broken down into groups of units to be worked on together.
There are also stories of subcontractors, in this country as well as overseas, crumpling a marker up so that when it is laid out again it will be just a little smaller in width and length'a trick to save a fraction of a percent from each piece.
Only after a common convention for bar codes had been established and in use for several years did retailers turn to such systems to transmit and receive data from suppliers.
If the sewing machine is correctly threaded, the operator then lifts the presser foot'a device that comes down on either side of the needle to hold the cloth'and, if the needle is in the up position, inserts the fabric.
Such retailers can also gather data about customer demographics, past purchases, and responses to potential substitute items, all of which add up to a gold mine of information about consumer preferences.
The items are then stored in a way that makes them easy to pick for an order about to be shipped.
Children become better at taking the perspective of their partner, especially a partner who adjusts his or her communication to the child's level and observes the child closely to assess his or her comprehension.
Otherwise, the two parties make independent decisions that myopically optimize their own profits, without complete consideration of the impact these decisions may have on other players in the channel.

For example, increasing the number of products offered in a category by a factor of four (say from fifty items to 200) without increasing total demand in the category would increase the coefficient of variation for each individual product by a factor of two.
As a result, product proliferation represents a shift in the curve relating sales volume and variability (see Figure 7.4).
As explained in previous chapters, variation in weekly demand can be characterized by a standardized measure, the coefficient of variation, or Cv.
Vivacious, stimulating parental behavior, including frequent questioning, instructing, and pointing out objects, is beneficial for reserved, inactive infants; it helps them become interested in and engaged with novel toys.
By 1920, over half of the spinning and weaving capacity was in the South, leading industrialization there.
Formally defined as the standard deviation of demand divided by average demand, the coefficient of variation can be considered a measure of variation that is normalized; it allows us to compare the variation of demand for different products, even if the average demand of the two products is quite different.
Finally, measurement, fit, color, and texture remain central components of apparel sales.
Basic items also represent a major percentage of all apparel goods sold.
These new practices'which we call lean retailing'have compelled apparel producers to reorganize the manner in which they relate to retail customers, undertake distribution, forecast and plan production, and manage their supplier relations.

The use of modern design tools and information technology can collapse the design time so that managerial decision-making becomes the longest step in the process'and even the time for that step can be shortened with information technology.
Simply put, the less certain retailers are of the demand for their product, the more safety stock they must hold to meet consumer needs.
They must desire genuine communication and work toward attaining it.
Yet most understand its great potential, even if they openly admit they don't have all the answers.
The buyer should order 250 units, since there is a 75 percent probability that demand will be less than this.
Because of this, most expensive automation equipment is concentrated in preassembly, drawing on multi-shift operations.
But the cases suggest that stepping in only in at times of crisis cannot compensate for providing the ongoing togetherness and haven of a family.
At best, experience with different combinations of waist sizes and leg lengths for a given design allows a scheduler to aggregate the units to be made into groups of large and small sizes, which means marker-makers can achieve efficiencies near 90 percent for casual pants.
Parents seemed unable to distinguish  good  from  substandard  care.
Consider the following problematic situations that parents recently raised with 
The increased volatility of producer and consumer prices in a number of sectors since 1995 has been attributed in part to the adoption of new inventory polices related to lean retailing.

In particular, advanced practices in distribution and modular production interact with each other because they both reduce throughput time.
The most up-to-date versions of automatic-cutting equipment, including the GERBERcutter, are even more effective.
Similarly, the probability of adopting modular systems in 1992 was 54 percent compared with 30 percent if bar codes and EDI were not both present.

Yet these nagging problems do not negate the need for a new approach to inventory management; they merely indicate how complicated supplier relationships have become.
For example, textile firms that supply retailers directly with their own products may have to combine equivalent information technologies with manufacturing innovations in finishing lines that shorten production cycles in order to gain competitive advantage.
But via a network that allows contractors access, manufacturers' headquarters can make sure that the information available is the most recent and complete.
Establishing the target customer base is therefore a critical first step in any merchandising strategy.
Product stock-outs accounted for 24 percent, $6 billion, of the losses, and the cost of inventory carrying itself constituted the remaining 20 percent, $5 billion.
Basic products are prime candidates for lean retailing because such a product style remains in a retailer and apparel company's product line over much of the selling season and often over several years.

Proposition 3 The assembly room'the traditional focus of attention for industry competitiveness'can provide competitive benefits only if other more fundamental changes in manufacturing practice have been introduced.
The parent or teacher intervenes only when the child is truly stuck, granting the child as much opportunity to master his or her own behavior as possible.
They have already transformed channel relations in such industries as food and grocery, home-building products, personal computers, and office products.
In preschools and kindergartens, behaviorist tenets were used to justify large-group drill on letters, numbers, and general knowledge as well as repetitive worksheet practice that required young children to sit at their desks for long periods, filling in blanks, coloring within the lines, and otherwise following teacher prescriptions.
But technical innovations have aided the operators.
For example, sketches or photos can be draped with material of different colors and patterns.
I spent hours daydreaming and looking at old pictures of Mom, Dad, Sarah, and me. 
This information infrastructure proved most beneficial when it gave Penney's major vendors access to sales data via direct broadcast satellite.
In other words, the savings created in throughput reduction in assembly were lost on the shipping dock.
But technical innovations have aided the operators.
Much research confirms that overloading children with input leads to disorganization of behavior.
In particular, retaining some short-cycle capacity may be advantageous for production of SKUs with higher levels of demand variation, whether because of fashion content or uncommon size'that is, for garments that have unique design elements or are in a size few consumers wear.
The Retail Fallout
During the 1980s, however, the amount of inventory held by Federated ballooned while it faced bankruptcy.
The employers in the stable shops with employees whom they were anxious to keep suffered as much as we did because the union was weak.
When a pattern piece is cut from the lay, the cutter then makes the notch cuts indicated on the marker.
This one-time staple has been replaced by shirts of dizzying diversity in fabric, design, and style, providing the final consumer with a huge assortment of shirts while exposing retailers and manufacturers to increased risk of holding large volumes of unsold goods.
In contrast, suppliers that have continued to innovate and expand their use of the four practices, as well as other activities described in previous chapters, keep outperforming the industry as a whole.
Based on our 1992 survey, we estimated lead times for two different   standard  lead times that represent performance for a typical product in the supplier's selection and  shortest  lead times that indicate a supplier's best practice.
 Oh, you want a cracker! 
High demand variation similarly occurs during the beginning and end of a product life cycle.
Putting another ply on top the same way creates an additional problem.
Ricky alternately named the numbers he recognized and counted items as they passed through the checkout.
The next two chapters examine apparel operations, starting with a look at the use of information technologies and automation equipment in the preassembly stages of garment-making (Chapter 8) and then the sewing room (Chapter 9).
Notice how Alison's imagination ranges far beyond the immediate play props before her'a tea set, a toy truck, and an ambulance.

Computer images can be viewed on the local area network or even put on the Internet in a secure form.
When a pattern piece is cut from the lay, the cutter then makes the notch cuts indicated on the marker.
Perhaps the second system cannot access events stored by the first, making the earliest events of our lives forever irretrievable.
Recently we read that how children turn out is mostly written in their genes; there's little we as parents can do about it.
At first glance, it might appear that almost all of the cloth is used in the marker; in fact, only 90 percent has been covered in the layout of 108 individual pieces.
Because introducing changes at any step may unbalance the system as a whole, technological innovations have not easily found their way into the sewing room'which may be out of sync with what an integrated retail-apparel-textile channel requires.
In the mid-1990s, Nordstrom ran newspaper ads promising, for certain products, that if the size or color of an item the customer wished to purchase was not in stock at the store, Nordstrom would locate the desired item and mail it to the customer at no additional cost'both the item and its delivery were free.
 Hmmm, might be an abalone shell.
Without those conversations, this level of insight is slow to develop.
When most people think of apparel design, they see fashion designers and models on runways.
American narratives rarely dwelt on misdeeds and, at times, even recast children's oenses as strengths'as indicative of quick thinking and an active, spirited disposition.
This method helps children move beyond concrete objects by looking for higher-order relationships'in Sydney's case, categorizing puzzle pieces by color and shape.
Genes and peers do not supplant adult agents, including parents, grandparents, aunts, uncles, family friends, and teachers.
At eight or ten stitches an inch, it is possible to seam thirteen to sixteen or more inches a second.
Basic products are prime candidates for lean retailing because such a product style remains in a retailer and apparel company's product line over much of the selling season and often over several years.
 Do you think that's what she wants? 
On the other hand, one would hate to lose the information that might be contained in past years' selling patterns.
It is based on an array of selective and equivocal findings, mustered to convince readers that parenting eects are confined to how children behave in parents' presence and do not extend beyond the home.
Once constructed, this persisting psychological self serves as an anchor for unique experiences, which are retained easily as long as they become personally meaningful.
At the dawn of a new millennium, a fresh set of theories of child development has blossomed.
The first pertains to operational performance, or the ability of a supplier to respond to lean retailing replenishment requirements.
The information-integrated channels developed in the United States, which are now influencing sourcing patterns from Mexico and the Caribbean Basin, have begun to affect the textile and apparel sectors worldwide.

A moment later, the clear, high-pitched sound of the whistle could be heard over the Rabbi's final shofar blast.
Vivacious, stimulating parental behavior, including frequent questioning, instructing, and pointing out objects, is beneficial for reserved, inactive infants; it helps them become interested in and engaged with novel toys.
Note that the work in a shirt plant is generally grouped into production lots of 1,500 shirts if the progressive bundle system is used.
In the new competitive arena'where demand uncertainty and time to market have become important factors along with price'textile firms are being forced to adapt to information-integrated channels, rather than just drawing on the economies of scale that led to their success in the past.
Mitch, in contrast, scores low on fearful distress and high on positive mood.
Authoritative parenting, whether assessed through direct observation or older children's ratings of their parents' communication, is linked to many aspects of competence.
The Retail Fallout
Once again, the development of Web sites to undertake some of these connections represents an important first step in this direction.
J. C. Penney built an internal data communications network well in advance of its use with suppliers.
Some over-edge sewing operations common with knit goods actually trim the edges of cloth just in front of the needle; in these cases any fused material from the laser cutting could be trimmed away.
While pretending, Vygotsky explained, children repeatedly face confiicts between the rules of the make-believe situation and what they would do if they could act impulsively, and they usually decide in favor of the rules.
This joint attention to objects and events fosters early language development.
Finally, the cloth must be spread in as many layers of thickness as necessary to achieve the number of units requested or as many as can be properly cut at one time.
These dialogues occur frequently and spontaneously as adults and children spend time together'in everyday situations such as household chores, mealtimes, play, storybook reading, outings in the community, and children's eorts to acquire all sorts of skills.
A number of developments, many linked to issues we have discussed, indicate both the potential and limitations of electronic retailing.
Junn Quechua children have diculty with false-belief tasks for years after children in industrialized nations have mastered them.
J. C. Penney built an internal data communications network well in advance of its use with suppliers.
Here the answer is a definite yes.

Profitability is measured as operating profit margin'revenue minus costs of goods sold divided by revenue.
These undergo a natural course of development through direct contact with the environment during the first two years of life, similar to the process of exploration and discovery described by Piaget.
So what has changed the prognosis for American apparel and textiles and provided new opportunities for these industries?
Then a unique marker must be created that combines different orders using the same fabric.
Parents, as I noted earlier, often complain that they have too little time for children'indeed, too little time to sleep, read, cook, exercise, and socialize as well!
The growth of private-label programs among retailers in the 1980s exemplifies this trend.
Mass customization, however, has the potential to make  tailor fit  at least somewhat less expensive, as new systems combine features of the efficient factory system with attention to at least a few critical customer measurements.
The costs associated with demand uncertainty, which were previously connected primarily with fashion products'that is, the problem of selling a highly perishable item'have grown enormously for apparel retailers.

Unlike PBS, however, SLS uses the single garment rather than the bundle as the unit of production.
It is true that textiles firms still sell to apparel-makers, which in turn sell to retailers, which ultimately sell to consumers.
The most important lesson we can take from Miller's provocative findings is that when parents and teachers take time to construct narratives with and about the young child, they create a  zone  that spurs children to weave moral and social rules into their self-definitions and to behave accordingly.
The changes now going on have their analog in the last century, when technological innovations of the day like railroads, telegraph, and steam power'developed for purposes far afield of retail, apparel, or textiles'helped transform the mass distri-bution of goods and information.
The baby has learned that only when he is distraught will the parent reliably come to his aid.
Because of rapid brain growth and gradual decline in brain plasticity, the first 5 to 8 years of life are regarded as a sensitive phase of development in which appropriate stimulation is necessary for children to reach their full genetic potential.

This method helps children move beyond concrete objects by looking for higher-order relationships'in Sydney's case, categorizing puzzle pieces by color and shape.
That is the basis of modern sewing operations in manufacturing facilities.
Too many families have separate adult-child living areas, each equipped with its own TV and other leisure pursuits so that parent-child dialogues seldom take place.
Mass customization, however, has the potential to make  tailor fit  at least somewhat less expensive, as new systems combine features of the efficient factory system with attention to at least a few critical customer measurements.
The operator must first select the work to be done, put aside the tickets that indicate she performed the sewing appropriate for those bundles and should be paid at the specified rate for the job, open the appropriate bundles, and position the pieces to be joined on the sewing table in preparation for sewing.
What about Piaget's belief that through make-believe, young children solidify their new symbolic capacity?
Through repetition of the task and coaching by experts, the operator would become very productive.
Cultures, and adults within them responsible for socialization, select dierent tasks for children's learning.
Subcontractors who might do cutting as well as sewing are provided with enough fabric to make the order.
A successful U.S. apparel-maker, for instance, may assemble basic men's khaki pants in average sizes in Mexico, taking advantage of low labor costs as well as Mexico's proximity to the maker's Texas distribution centers; at the same time, this company can choose to manufacture products with more variable demand, like khaki pants with narrow waists and long inseams, in the United States, providing fast turnaround for retailers and lower exposure to inventory risk.
She has a cut, see?
In all the ways just mentioned, parents and other adults are vital conveyers of culture, through direct teaching of attitudes and values and through the pervasive imprint of culture on the settings and activities they provide for children.
Yet the income gap in free time is not large; financially well-o individuals average only 2 to 4 hours a week less free time than do their less economically advantaged counterparts.
Establishing the target customer base is therefore a critical first step in any merchandising strategy.
How can parents beat the  time bind ?
They would then take their body measurements to any of several participating retailers, who pass the information on to their apparel suppliers and have the clothing custom-made.
As explained in previous chapters, variation in weekly demand can be characterized by a standardized measure, the coefficient of variation, or Cv.
What happened? 
Finally, measurement, fit, color, and texture remain central components of apparel sales.
Here we will show how a decision tool can be used to make the transition from general intuition to specific decisions about (1) which products to make in each plant and (2) how to schedule the time and quantity of production for each product.
Manufacturers suddenly have much more to do than just make clothing'they are being asked to do work previously done by the retailer, such as picking and packing the order for each store from the retailer's warehouse.
Some remain profoundly impaired by inadequate adult investment in their childhoods.
The parent always in a hurry'who says, when the child desires involvement,  There isn't time,  or who fails to insist that the child join in household tasks in keeping with his or her capacity'severely limits the child's learning.
As Figure 6.6 shows, the safety stock needed to achieve a given customer service level is proportional to the standard deviation of the demand forecast.
Human Resources and Productivity Growth
In this period, a number of key technological changes  sewing machines that made many more stitches a minute, long knives instead of shears for cutting, and pressing machines.
We continue to assume that this SKU has the weekly demand distribution shown in Figure 6.1 (page 92).
When bar codes and EDI are combined with advanced shipping practices, the benefit of each practice is enhanced; order processing occurs more rapidly, accurately, and with less paper.
When somebody orders custom-made clothing, his or her measurements are taken by a fitter in a store and, three to six weeks later, the garment appears.
Increased rates of product introduction, product proliferation, and shortened product cycles mean that companies have to respond much faster to rapidly changing markets.
Putting another ply on top the same way creates an additional problem.
As a result, they do not have to be preoccupied with those needs and, instead, can turn their attention outward, toward acquiring physical, cognitive, and social skills.
This chapter also describes a new approach to production and sourcing strategies, one that balances traditional and short-cycle production lines.
 Do you think that's what she wants? 
In sociocultural theory, this joint, mutual focus is called intersubjectivity, or shared understanding.
Adjust the task to an appropriately challenging level, and tailor teaching and assistance to the child's changing needs.
The jagged heavy line in Figure 6.5 (page 100) depicts a typical inventory pattern for a replenishable product like our blue jeans in size 8. Note that the inventory level drops gradually as consumers purchase the item.
Consequently, Sydney begins to move toward independent solving of the puzzle.
 From Fiber to Cloth to Finished Product
The optimal policy is one for which marginal increases or decreases in chosen inventory levels will not confer additional profits.
The jagged heavy line in Figure 6.5 (page 100) depicts a typical inventory pattern for a replenishable product like our blue jeans in size 8. Note that the inventory level drops gradually as consumers purchase the item.
They have already transformed channel relations in such industries as food and grocery, home-building products, personal computers, and office products.
These findings are not an indictment of maternal employment or nonparental child care.
As early as 1 1/2 to 2 years, children begin to talk about the past, guided by adults who prompt them and expand on their fragmented recollections.
The most up-to-date versions of automatic-cutting equipment, including the GERBERcutter, are even more effective.
We first turn to the problem of forecasting sales in retail stores.
Can sort shapes into categories.
Even after controlling for the independent effects of firm size, product mix, and distribution channel on performance, we found that the most innovative firms were significantly more profitable than those that had adopted fewer of the key practices.
For example, the success of The Gap's jeans, J. C. Penney's Arizona line, and Sears's Canyon River Blue line has led to erosion of the market share held by the two leading jeans manufacturers, Levi Strauss and VF Corporation.
Increased profit came from missing fewer sales by being in stock a higher percentage of the time.
The forecasting and inventory models presented in this chapter are not new; they have been recommended for years by statisticians and operations researchers.
And what can be done to ameliorate sweatshop conditions in developing countries that produce and export half of the apparel purchased in this country?
 You went treating!
Wal-Mart is the most well known of the early lean retailers.
As a result, some of the fashion-oriented products that had been sourced offshore can then return to the United States.
Our work on apparel supplier adjustments to lean retailing suggests that an economy characterized by an increasing level of modern manufacturing and retailing practices should experience lower levels of inventories relative to sales.
Markets certainly have not disappeared, but these relationships have been transformed.
Chapters 13 through 15 examine the channel as a whole, from global, private-performance, and public-policy perspectives.
Sophie turned toward the teddy bear, lifted his paw, and exclaimed,  She wants a lollipop to hold in her hand! 
Indeed, efforts to use public concern, and at times outrage, to tackle the sweatshop problem go back to the early part of this century.
