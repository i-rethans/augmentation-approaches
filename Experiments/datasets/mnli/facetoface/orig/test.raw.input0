I was on this earth you know, I've lived on this earth for some reason, I just don't know what it is yet.
All that day, we didn't get up (off the floor).
Do you smoke her Saratogas?
Where in Charlotte?
Um, I read some of the same books that they had read to me, first, and then, as I got older, I just got hungry for books.
It just kind a fills it out a little bit makes it a little easier on the ear especially if they can't sing but.
Uh, we used to sit on her back porch and uh snap uh beans or what they called doing snap beans, uh, which was really just taking green beans and snapping them into smaller pieces.
The music industry.
She's a, she works in a warehouse now, actually.
she said to them, because of you we're going to die too, through no fault of our own!
Definitely the freedom, definitely the freedom.
Well that window happened to be through her room, so I just kind of walked on through the room and she looked up at me and I said, Good morning, and she just screamed.
Like because my dad always treated me like a boy because I was like I was the first girl on my dad's side of the family in like, four generations or something like that.
Wha, yeah, very hard compared to high school.
Open the door, please.
Do you remember being read to when you were little?
It truly was my life in high school.
So, it's like she, uh, and the education wasn't the same back in those days.
And I said to some of my cousins that I had only the last I had seen was at Grandpop's funeral.
Something to that effect.
Did you have lots of storybooks at your house that were read to you?
But I do got a 100 dollars.
They were scary, throwing a child in the oven and all that sort of thing!
Is there a favorite story or storybook or anything that you had when you were little that somebody read to you?
I really don't.
And, anyway, uh, anyway, went on from there, started doing a lot of stuff in college working with um one person specifically.
I'm going to do Education now.
Are they, like, rounded?
I don't know what, he sells like cars or something.
Because I'm like a lifeguard every summer and this year I had to get a winter job all year.
We would all slide the windows down on the bus open the door, stick your head out the door, you couldn't hear anything coming that way, you couldn't hear anything coming the other way, and he'd just drop it in low and gun it, we would make it another morning.
You shouldn't drink that non-pasteurized milk, but hey, it never hurt us.
Well, some of them that uh, with your mother Marsha uh, I she was, I believe about 18 when I was born.
Elbert, I just want to ask you uh, some questions about your experience with uh, stories.
That must be a really big deal.
We thought it would be cool to see just how far a BB would shoot.
But, um, It's not like I'll never come back and visit or anything like that.
But, um, It's not like I'll never come back and visit or anything like that.
Your mother wasn't real happy about that.
Does she like what she does?
I look around well he was right here.
That was the first time I saw them, the gue, the guerillas.
Um, Can we turn that off while I think?
Is there a favorite story or storybook or anything that you had when you were little that somebody read to you?
My father didn't read anything in terms of what you'd call a book, uh, but he was analytical of the Sport of Kings, and, so would peruse the paper to check on that . But, uh, my mother, uh, you know, didn't read a whole lot, but spent a lot of time reading to me, uh, my being an only child.
Um, she always kept all her bills and expenses at an absolute minimum ran everything very efficiently kept an extremely tidy house uh.
Does he ever let you drive the car?
Are you going to buy any gifts for people or make anything?
You still do.
So, then, I grabbed him, and when I grabbed him, I put him under the bed, and I went outside.
Well, let's see, there's I guess one of the favorite author's of mine is Isaac Asimov who wrote some of the best science and science fiction that was ever written.
Yeah, I liked it a lot.
\\ How \\, how come?
Um, do you remember everything that your mom, like when she's telling the story, do you remember everything she tells or is some of it you remember and some of it you don't?
You still do.
And do you read a lot?
And he said, Ma'am, he said, what did the guerrillas that were there eating do with themselves?
It would be so damn foggy you could not see the yellow line on that divided highway in front of you and we to turn left out onto this highway.
It's not a family story.
He worked, he's a teacher, and at that time he worked as the principal of that school, of that school, because it was a, like a high school, there was, from first (grade) to high school.
We won't let her see the tape.
Now that, that you're an adult obviously and have had children of your own what stories do you remember telling to your own children, and reading to your own children?
There was one particular woman I don't recall her name.
Um, Peyton Place was, had, um, kind of a fascination because I was at summer camp in NH, near Gilmanton Iron Works, where that woman, the author, lived.
Go ahead Adam.
That was Robert Frost.
Would you say that um, your mom or you dad or whoever is telling the story, tells that part of the story, the, the last part when you came to the door and she saw the glow of light, would you say that they tell that part of the story more than any other part or do they tell the whole thing from beginning to end?
// The gas station part.
It was always warm.
Like neither, like I'm the first one in my family to go to college on my dad's side.
And you were born in Presbyterian Hospital.
How about um, your kids?
So, I have my sister's kid here and I'm going to kill him underneath this vehicle shortly.
What how often.
Go ahead Adam.
What were your least favorite parts of the story?
Like in most schools in Charlotte, if you go on other sides, it's like everybody's just white, but in my school, there was every kind of person you could ever meet.
I had, had put in several weeks that were between 60 and 90 hours a week.
I look around well he was right here.
Uh, how important it was to read and we're all English majors, I think that has something to do with it; my brother, sister and I are all, we're all English majors in college.
\\ How \\, how come?
Anything you remember?
They were, um, they were best-seller type fiction from the um, 40's and 50's and 60's and on, just, they were members of a book club and they got a lot of books that way.
Now where did you, when you were hearing these stories, your mother was telling them to you, where were you living at the time?
Not that I can remember, no, uh uh.
That same while that I was there at my brother's, we went to look for, the people who owned land, to see if they would give me, pasture land for the animals.
Yeah, but I've done it for so long, I'm used to like lifeguard and like everything like that.
What does he do?
My favorite story, um, oh, Cinderella.
How about does um, your Dad read any stories to you?
It was about seven or eight feet tall.
Yeah, he taxied to a gas station to fill it up.
Unless I'm like, when I go home for like Christmas break, after being there for like two weeks, it was like I'd never moved out and we get kind of like tense with each other.
Ah, Uncle Wiggly was a favorite.
I said to him, that they want to do in that meeting?
They say we're going up in the mountains to find some snow.
It was something that they were in a position to do one time and no one before or no one since could ever reduplicate it.
Um, I guess the time when I was four.
So you'll go back to school if that doesn't work out?
Like because my dad always treated me like a boy because I was like I was the first girl on my dad's side of the family in like, four generations or something like that.
And it, it kind of makes me feel bad.
That one time you were trying to take that floor joist.
So I didn't like that at first, and then, of course, you know, as the story unfolded, you would, uh, relate that to your own experiences of being afraid and, and learning to conquer those fears and that kind of thing.
What kind of stories does she tell you?
Or do would they rather you have stay in Nursing?
Five years.
And, um, I just wish that my counselor would have been more helpful to me.
And uh, I don't remember the specifics as to what he did, but the bus driver Louie was about four and a half feet tall driving a 72-passenger diesel bus.
So I remember silly things like that, that were a lot of fun . I read, uh, the story that, I don't, this isn't, ah, I think the first real story that I read was, uh, The Red Badge of Courage.
( ) When cancer comes up I'm just pretty, pretty interested in it, to find out what they went through and I can relate to it.
Umm, go ahead and tell me about a story.
So, what I am going to ask you is what was your philosophy behind that?
How old were you when she shared this story with you?
OK, I thought so.
That's a little bit of pressure, though.
We didn't get to spend any time with each other and just being married, and, you know, within a year or so or a year or two it was, um, Kim being unfamiliar with, with New York City and not really liking it very much.
We uh, we would run our safety drills at the elementary school.
Let's see, recent authors You've probably never heard of any of these, but Gregory Benford is very good, these are science fiction, uh, see David Grant, science fiction that is real good.
A favorite story about anything?
But stories I remember hearing one of uh, I believe it was Marsha uh, the wind caught the storm door there she was, she was uh, hanging on to the back storm door and I guess pulled it open a little bit to see what was going on and the wind caught it and threw her right out in the yard.
And it was an important aspect, was there a particular crowd that hung out because of that?
It's definitely grown.
My dad he, I don't know, he doesn't think I'm stupid, but he doesn't he wants better for me, than what he has.
How about when you were in school?
We didn't get to spend any time with each other and just being married, and, you know, within a year or so or a year or two it was, um, Kim being unfamiliar with, with New York City and not really liking it very much.
People just don't have the time or take the time to keep the traditions going they just get too busy or too lazy.
OK Adam is now going to talk about the music industry.
Um, what kind of things did you remember reading when you started to read?
Can you retell the story?
And it was one afternoon I was out playing on the uh, sidewalk and uh Mom was, Mom was in the kitchen doing something and I was, I guess pretending to act like a salesman and I went up to the front door and rang the doorbell.
I said, Well we got some // gasoline.
The bull start making his noises and all that other stuff.
I, I do think they read to them when they are little.
Nothing I can remember that I got hurt.
Yeah, I have a son that uh, likes to relive the tragedy of his split lip.
Lot of times we just sit around and just reminisce and go back to the time when we were growing up.
I mean literally you could just see it hang, it looked like a fire scene on the news it was awful.
Groundhog hole found the front tire of the motorcycle and I managed to fly over the handlebars.
It's kind of a, which is the cause and which is the effect, question.
We were putting siding on her house and beat on the door nobody comes to the door it's summertime everybody sleeping until 10:00.
We were putting siding on her house and beat on the door nobody comes to the door it's summertime everybody sleeping until 10:00.
I read everything I could get my hands on.
Ah, Uncle Wiggly was a favorite.
Why wouldn't you want to stay on Charlotte?
Whose girls?
Uh Asimov, he died about 8 years ago but I still find one or two of his that I hadn't read yet.
She's a, she works in a warehouse now, actually.
Um, Can we turn that off while I think?
Something to that effect.
Um, well I know it was before I was five, probably, I know at least four and I'm sure she read to me before that.
And I have it back in my room.
I won't tell.
She's a, she works in a warehouse now, actually.
There's, my dad reminds me from time to time.
They would rather me stay in Nursing because they know that's where my heart is but, um, you know, they're behind me in whatever I decide to do.
How far away?
You can stop.
But if we didn't want to work with them, we shouldn't get them into anything with the mil, military, such as, informing on them, or something like that.
Yeah, I know he had on pants, he had on a long sleeve I think the cuffs were rolled up once or twice.
So he says, No, from the school up, are all guerrillas.
I do, but it gets to a point where like I feel like if I fail, it's just going to be like way too much for everybody.
I always had to get up early, milk the cows, and, uh, run, run them, as we say, because it's a, to the pastures, until times got pretty bad, and one day, I sent my daughter to, to the pasture to bring in the cows.
Well, let's see.
They were scary, throwing a child in the oven and all that sort of thing!
Umm, I guess I'll leave it at that.
We lived between, between the border of Honduras and El Salvador.
No, they didn't, no, just that one.
But you ended up with blood poisoning from all the gasoline.
I don't know what, he sells like cars or something.
How do they feel about your being a Theater major?
And I have it back in my room.
I read everything I could get my hands on.
Not any stories that she used to tell.
Grandpop was a very quiet, somber man he wouldn't say much but uh, Gra ndmom was a little more boisterous.
Like neither, like I'm the first one in my family to go to college on my dad's side.
I was a mistake.
I guess one of the other authors I like a lot uh is C.S.
It was a series of little fiction stories, and my mother must have read me every single one of them.
And like my family's a big part of it.
Like one, two, three, four.
He motioned to me as if they were going to cut off his head.
They're making trincheras, they call them trincheras, where they're putting mounds of stones near the houses, so that the bullets there.
So, early that morning, that afternoon, I came down from San Miguel, and I told him, I'm going to go.
The whole thing?
You don't know.
Do you play football a lot?
My name is Gloria Cotton.
Probably Lois, your Aunt Lois.
And the lion ate him.
That was the first time I saw them, the gue, the guerillas.
Tell me about your bike.
This is a story that my dad told me when I was small, a long time ago that, there was a girl that, she was very young, she was going to go visit her parents.
I couldn't have done it.
I just loved Cinderella . I also saw my sisters as the wicked stepsisters sometimes , and I was Cinderella, running around waiting on them.
Um, I wanted to be closer to my family, number one, and, um, number two, I have a lot of friends coming here, which helped me a lot, and, um, I just liked the Charlotte, um, UNC Charlotte because I wanted to be a, a nurse.
West side of Charlotte.
I can't think of anything, but it's been nice chatting with you.
But fortunately they didn't.
My dad still doesn't believe me.
You can stop.
Because, there were a lot more things.
People just don't have the time or take the time to keep the traditions going they just get too busy or too lazy.
What kind of stories does she tell you?
Where is, where was this?
That's why it's such like a big thing, because my uncle, he went, he went into the military and then came out.
\\ They wasn't ghosts.
The book just tied right into it.
Um, Christmas is coming up pretty soon huh?
I love to read just plain history, um, it must have rubbed off in some aspect because that's the kind of thing I still read.
Do you think they've become more ex, do you think they've accepted more what you've decided to do or that's going to take a while?
It's a story from The Bible.
Well, you know, to this day every now and then that particular story comes up every now and then.
I'm opening up like five pools and they're giving me a headache because they all turned green today, so, that's like the most fun job for me.
Uh, so yeah, I took up a lot of her life and she read a lot of children's stories to me as a result of that, but I don't believe she read a lot for her own amusement.
Do you know what a teja is?
And uh, my parents and I had stopped many times in a little town called New Market, VA which was just a // little, // yeah it seemed like a halfway point.
I said to him, don't you know, Chepe, what it is?
And who told you that story?
But, then like me and my mom will talk all the time and she'll come over here and she'll like have a beer and a cigarette with me and it doesn't matter anymore!
Would you say that um, your mom or you dad or whoever is telling the story, tells that part of the story, the, the last part when you came to the door and she saw the glow of light, would you say that they tell that part of the story more than any other part or do they tell the whole thing from beginning to end?
Um, is the United States your, uh, birth country?
It's a relatively painless experience and not very cumbersome to deal with, not bad.
And so what year does that make you, are you a--?
That's a little bit of pressure, though.
Go ahead Adam.
I think that was kind of hard for him, you know.
Why is reading so important?
And it was an important aspect, was there a particular crowd that hung out because of that?
But then, ha, ha that changed quickly.
I guess I had a friend staying overnight.
Uh, so yeah, I took up a lot of her life and she read a lot of children's stories to me as a result of that, but I don't believe she read a lot for her own amusement.
Where in Charlotte?
OK, I said, So, how do we do it?
Does he ever let you drive the car?
Real currently, what do you enjoy reading at the present?
Um, I wish I could think more.
I'll ask you first Mom, and then Dad.
So we quick think and I go, well grab a paper towel and wet it and throw a couple of ice cubes in and put it on his hand, get him up to his feet and haul him off to the emergency room.
Yeah, I liked it a lot.
I've been going up as a progress in school, so I, it will be a good change for me.
I can remember Mom and Dad saying Grandmom in the kitchen hollering, Daddy, Daddy, Daddy I wish you wouldn't talk like that in front of the girls.
First Grade.
OK Adam is now going to talk about the music industry.
He was paying him five bucks an hour and he would, he could work all day Wednesday and uh, but I believe it was on that job there, that Kavalo, that Dad said, Look boy you can read a tape measure better that this forty year old man can so I'll give you five bucks an hour if you prove you can do it.
Tough question.
Whose girls?
A snowboard --.
I would like to look for a job in education, possibly teaching elementary school, um, hopefully up north I would rather do that up north, so--
Of course you only had a thousand students through all those six grades.
Um, not really anything unusual.
There was also a candy store about three or four blocks in the other direction called Pud's that we used to walk up to and across the street from Pud's was the local fire department and the uh the firemen used to let us play on the fire engines which is completely unheard of nowadays but they let us you know climb all over them, get inside and honk the horns you know put on fire jacket and boots or whatever we wanted to do and uh I guess there just weren't a lot of fires in Asheville in that part of town because they never seemed to be concerned that we would be interfering with their preparedness.
How was it going to high school in Charlotte?
They can change the tone of people's voice yes.
It's just not me.
They made up stories sometimes, my mother in particular, she made up stories.
Um, my mom has because she knows how important it is to me and everything like that and my dad actually two weeks ago when I went home, I don't even remember why I went home, but I went home for something and he's like, he's still trying to convince me to double major.
Um, what other, now I know you worked with your dad in the beginning there when you were quite younger.
We call this our home because this is where we were raised at.
she said to them, because of you we're going to die too, through no fault of our own!
You were there, the upchuck wagon.
And you said, How do I get this tar off of me uncle?
And do you feel like it was a good thing to grow up around?
We arrived, at my brother's, and Cristobal, with the livestock and the rest, still hadn't arrived.
I feel like I'm letting them down, so to, so to speak.
No, they didn't, no, just that one.
Actually, my sister wrote a story on it.
Well, probably the favorite book I had, this is a little different I had The Giant Golden Book of Astronomy, which I got when I was in the second grade and I read it cover to cover till I wore it out.
What kind of, do you ever tell stories to your little sister?
It was a very interesting experience.
Now you're in, in what grade?
But I'm never going to take the knives out.
Have you ever read any books from foreign authors?
And I said to some of my cousins that I had only the last I had seen was at Grandpop's funeral.
He liked it a little warmer.
So we took a chance on it and started following the billboards.
Smacked my chest.
Um we always tended to stop somewhere scenic either going to or coming from.
Um, Peyton Place was, had, um, kind of a fascination because I was at summer camp in NH, near Gilmanton Iron Works, where that woman, the author, lived.
Oh yes, yes they did.
So, then, I grabbed him, and when I grabbed him, I put him under the bed, and I went outside.
Uh, how important it was to read and we're all English majors, I think that has something to do with it; my brother, sister and I are all, we're all English majors in college.
How old are you talking about?
So it's almost like a second home.
I said, Well you can use paint thinner or turpentine or gasoline.
Now you're in, in what grade?
What, you said that you were four?
But if we didn't want to work with them, we shouldn't get them into anything with the mil, military, such as, informing on them, or something like that.
Chased him all the way up to the upstairs, I don't think the bird ever even pooped in the house not that we found--
Work a lot harder, um, take some classes that I think are going to interest me more.
But like, so I was always raised like a tomboy and everything like that and my dad treated me like a guy all the time.
Not really, that's all.
Well, he milked the cow every morning, but that day, he couldn't milk her, because the gunfire was so heavy, and because everything was falling near the house.
A favorite story about anything?
Is there anything specific that, uh, you remember about your grandma?
// All the time.
Nothing I re, that I recall.
Oh yeah, I want to quit early today.
It's a nice place to grow up.
\\ Can you remember the very first stories that were read when you were little?
And you were born in Presbyterian Hospital.
Do you read Dr. Seuss?
Um, what do you remember any stories they told you, your parents told you?
And then there was never like any female blood Averetts until like my oldest cousin had kids.
So you guys get along really well now?
Well, because it was really interesting stuff.
He said to me, You have to go, he said to me.
But stories I remember hearing one of uh, I believe it was Marsha uh, the wind caught the storm door there she was, she was uh, hanging on to the back storm door and I guess pulled it open a little bit to see what was going on and the wind caught it and threw her right out in the yard.
How should I start?
What how often.
--the teachers were much more, I guess, I don't know???
That must be a really big deal.
We had a great big book of Grimm's Fairytales, and looking back on that they were grim!
They grew up in Lewisburg, NC, which is a little small town it's east of Raleigh.
Now where did you, when you were hearing these stories, your mother was telling them to you, where were you living at the time?
Somebody who obviously that English was not their first language, but they wrote a book?
So I think maybe, reading for young people, is not as important.
Well that window happened to be through her room, so I just kind of walked on through the room and she looked up at me and I said, Good morning, and she just screamed.
Are you reading things?
Well, let's see, there's I guess one of the favorite author's of mine is Isaac Asimov who wrote some of the best science and science fiction that was ever written.
Where, where are you working now?
And uh, my parents and I had stopped many times in a little town called New Market, VA which was just a // little, // yeah it seemed like a halfway point.
Hold it as long as you can.
Because they're going to set up a committee, he said to me, so that when those big battalions, he said to me, of guerrillas arrive, these people attend, for example, the president is going to talk to the rest so that they all get food together for them.
Or do you feel like in general that's how high school is as opposed to college?
You do numbers real fast?
You couldn't leave it if you didn't rinse your glass out after you got drinking after you got done drinking it would stick to the glass to the point where you'd have to scrape it.
Well, so many bullets, so many things.
Lenient  --lenient, you know.
I think she must have enjoyed it because she read them to us too.
I think that's one I remember, a lot because when I was in 1st grade, I was sick a lot of the year, and I was out of school a lot of the year.
Did you read this story itself, yourself, when you were young, or was it first told to you by someone?
Um, she always kept all her bills and expenses at an absolute minimum ran everything very efficiently kept an extremely tidy house uh.
Um we always tended to stop somewhere scenic either going to or coming from.
I had, had put in several weeks that were between 60 and 90 hours a week.
// The fine county of Gaston.
I have nobody here to guide me.
I liked those Disney World things.
What were your least favorite parts of the story?
Uh Asimov, he died about 8 years ago but I still find one or two of his that I hadn't read yet.
That was the deal for them to get off my back and let me do what I wanted to do.
My, and I somehow managed to convince my, my mother and stepfather, of the time, to uh get me a couple of turn tables and started mixing songs and scratching and doing all that D.J. stuff.
It's a nice place to grow up.
In high school I was, you know, 3.0's, you knows A's and B's an occasional C. Now here I'm lucky if I get a C on something.
I would like to look for a job in education, possibly teaching elementary school, um, hopefully up north I would rather do that up north, so--
Yeah that's one that I like.
It was always warm.
You got a job cutting siding wasn't it?
My favorite story, um, oh, Cinderella.
The music industry, well, you want more of the juicy, sordid details.
But it was a bunch of wild and crazy stories.
Because they're going to set up a committee, he said to me, so that when those big battalions, he said to me, of guerrillas arrive, these people attend, for example, the president is going to talk to the rest so that they all get food together for them.
And this is, I guess, after, after high school, kind of right before college, actually, while I was in college, before I went away to school, while I was still in Brooklyn.
And I have it back in my room.
And, uh, I assume, um, that English is your native language.
It's not a family story.
Do you play football a lot?
There was also a candy store about three or four blocks in the other direction called Pud's that we used to walk up to and across the street from Pud's was the local fire department and the uh the firemen used to let us play on the fire engines which is completely unheard of nowadays but they let us you know climb all over them, get inside and honk the horns you know put on fire jacket and boots or whatever we wanted to do and uh I guess there just weren't a lot of fires in Asheville in that part of town because they never seemed to be concerned that we would be interfering with their preparedness.
Because I'm like a lifeguard every summer and this year I had to get a winter job all year.
A, a DJ by the name of Funk Master Flex, who put out a few albums and I don't even remember what they called.
My ankle.
My ankle.
Um, the joys, joys and fun of construction.
I didn't do a lot of reading.
It's just not me.
You have a good attitude about it, though!
Black and white yeah.
Thank, thank you for your stories.
You can go out on the weekends but during the week it, you know, it should be study time.
Um, not too many stories about my dad's childhood.
Anything you remember?
Uh, well, would you care to relate the story to me now?
Um, she pretty much showed a lot of disinterest at best and, and outright hostility at worst towards my mom until we the kids came along.
We arrived, at my brother's, and Cristobal, with the livestock and the rest, still hadn't arrived.
You would open the back door and you felt like you were big stuff.
Well, so many bullets, so many things.
So you couldn't tell what kind, at night, what kind of people were going by, but you could hear clatter, because even beasts full of weapons, with, everything, you know?
It would be so damn foggy you could not see the yellow line on that divided highway in front of you and we to turn left out onto this highway.
And that's like I can totally see my dad in my personality.
The Lord helped me for a reason.
I think she must have enjoyed it because she read them to us too.
Well, it would probably been things like living back in the hills of TN and having to ride a mule to school, things like that.
And what's your major?
You couldn't leave it if you didn't rinse your glass out after you got drinking after you got done drinking it would stick to the glass to the point where you'd have to scrape it.
One of the wife's brothers had come.
So you guys get along really well now?
he said to me.
Yeah, I have a son that uh, likes to relive the tragedy of his split lip.
So I liked that.
And uh she had just cartons and cartons of soup labels that she had saved over the years and redeem them you know I don't know five cents a bushel so she was very practical in that regard.
My mom believes me, because she knows I'll go.
Um, Peyton Place was, had, um, kind of a fascination because I was at summer camp in NH, near Gilmanton Iron Works, where that woman, the author, lived.
Yeah on some of the songs yeah.
But like, so I was always raised like a tomboy and everything like that and my dad treated me like a guy all the time.
What, you said that you were four?
Because my whole first year, I didn't work.
So, we stayed there.
They made up stories sometimes, my mother in particular, she made up stories.
And did you find that to be kind of hard, or did, you know--?
We were mentioning, we were mentioning writers you enjoy reading now and we had to take a break.
Uh, I loved the part where they would, you know, make things out of nothing.
What I liked about it was that kids were special.
Somewhere in VA Marsha sees a billboard for this restaurant to eat at.
Not really, that's all.
Grandpop was a very quiet, somber man he wouldn't say much but uh, Gra ndmom was a little more boisterous.
Oh well, the cultural differences would come through in the writing, yeah, sure.
It's just one of those things, you know that happened.
Work hard study balance your time, you know.
Did you notice any differences between an American writer and someone of foreign descent?
Did he ever tell you any other stories?
So you couldn't tell what kind, at night, what kind of people were going by, but you could hear clatter, because even beasts full of weapons, with, everything, you know?
How should I start?
I don't remember, but only, only a fractured collarbone, which I recommend to anyone that needs to break a bone, break a collarbone.
He was paying him five bucks an hour and he would, he could work all day Wednesday and uh, but I believe it was on that job there, that Kavalo, that Dad said, Look boy you can read a tape measure better that this forty year old man can so I'll give you five bucks an hour if you prove you can do it.
Um, I wanted to be closer to my family, number one, and, um, number two, I have a lot of friends coming here, which helped me a lot, and, um, I just liked the Charlotte, um, UNC Charlotte because I wanted to be a, a nurse.
Groundhog hole found the front tire of the motorcycle and I managed to fly over the handlebars.
Well, they must have because I still read fiction.
So it's, it's written, as opposed to oral?
I've been going up as a progress in school, so I, it will be a good change for me.
A, a DJ by the name of Funk Master Flex, who put out a few albums and I don't even remember what they called.
What writers?
Yeah I had to take it, as children?
I've, I've decided and it's very hard.
Yeah, that's true.
Well, do you remember one of those particular stories that um, might come up when you're just sitting around reminiscing?
I think that was kind of hard for him, you know.
Don't they do that a lot with like Britney Spears and people like that?
It's just not me.
Met my first girlfriend that way.
She waits tables like one night a week at another job to help put me through and everything like that.
I do, but it gets to a point where like I feel like if I fail, it's just going to be like way too much for everybody.
Luis Alonso, Luis Alonso, says to him, Luis Alonso's friend.
Do you remember being read to when you were little?
Well, you know, to this day every now and then that particular story comes up every now and then.
And uh, me and my friend there we'd always sit together in the first or second seat on the bus.
I don't know what, he sells like cars or something.
Lot of times we just sit around and just reminisce and go back to the time when we were growing up.
Do you remember any stories about Grandma Mackton, your mom's a little bit?
So, I'm kind of like the hope, I guess.
But fortunately they didn't.
Tough question.
But you ended up with blood poisoning from all the gasoline.
( ) When cancer comes up I'm just pretty, pretty interested in it, to find out what they went through and I can relate to it.
One thing in particular she used to save would be soup labels.
I know about that!
So you'll go back to school if that doesn't work out?
Um, also a pothead, but not really so consumed with it necessarily.
Tell me about your bike.
But you ended up with blood poisoning from all the gasoline.
Did you identify with any of these characters?
Uh, we used to walk up to the local grocery store, uh, which was about three or four blocks away.
We had a barn, a dairy farm that was maybe quarter of a mile from the house and uh, Mama say, We need milk.
My mom believes me, because she knows I'll go.
They took out all the rest (of the shrapnel), but the one in his eyebrow, they couldn't get it out.
She remembered poems that she had learned when she was in high school.
What I liked about it was that kids were special.
Black cover with white, black and white.
Well, let's see.
The crate.
But uh, come mealtime boy this little apartment with central air conditioning running, the smoke hung about four and a half five feet down from the ceiling.
Do you remember any stories about Grandma Mackton, your mom's a little bit?
My mom knows.
A lot of his books aren't really fiction but scientific essays that he prepared for publication.
And uh, me and my friend there we'd always sit together in the first or second seat on the bus.
Can you remember the first story that you can remember anyone telling you some of the first memories of someone telling you a story?
Uh she had a big garage that was separate from the house and almost bigger than the house it was almost like it was a barn.
They made up stories sometimes, my mother in particular, she made up stories.
What was, well you clearly remember this story, but once you got a little older and could remember a little better, what would you say some of your favorite stories and books were, as a child growing up?
They have a place here too.
Well, as a teacher, do you see reading as something that is still important in families today?
I said to him, But you know, I'm your friend, tell me why.
Uh, how important it was to read and we're all English majors, I think that has something to do with it; my brother, sister and I are all, we're all English majors in college.
I fact, I took you to Louisa May Alcott's home in Massachusetts, and we, ah, umm--.
It was about seven or eight feet tall.
Actually my first semester at Charlotte, I was a Pre-Business major to go into Marketing and Advertising, because I did that in high school, too.
I look nobody is standing at the saw.
I read a lot of other authors that weren't, weren't as good writers but also had interesting ideas.
I'm opening up like five pools and they're giving me a headache because they all turned green today, so, that's like the most fun job for me.
I have nobody here to guide me.
I mean, like my junior year of high school the first dress I ever owned was my junior year prom dress!
I think that's one I remember, a lot because when I was in 1st grade, I was sick a lot of the year, and I was out of school a lot of the year.
And, how old are you?
Well, and I forgot to tell you when the soldiers came, to my house, the guerrillas were there, the guerrillas went back.
If you want to keep on, that's fine, but, so much time!
And storytelling applies?
What kind of, do you ever tell stories to your little sister?
Anything you remember?
I won't tell.
Ooh, one of my three older sisters.
This is a story that my dad told me when I was small, a long time ago that, there was a girl that, she was very young, she was going to go visit her parents.
I was old enough at the time that I knew what was going on.
I mean, like my junior year of high school the first dress I ever owned was my junior year prom dress!
So this story was read to you by your cousins?
Uh, I loved the part where they would, you know, make things out of nothing.
What does he do for a living?
They were, um, they were best-seller type fiction from the um, 40's and 50's and 60's and on, just, they were members of a book club and they got a lot of books that way.
Do you feel like that's just in Charlotte that that's how the school systems are?
He had a pillow, one of those big pillows, and it looked red, all of it with blood and swollen like this . So he said, from the running down from several places, but the one that, this one [indicates eyebrow], was, was too much.
I'm going to cut it with the, a knife, the knot, so the cow can go and she won't die.
Like when I lived at home, we did not get along at all for anything in the world; we would fight all the time.
And so, uh, those things come about through the work of reading rather than through listening to some person on the street corner or, uh, gazing on TV.
--the teachers were much more, I guess, I don't know???
What's your favorite toy?
What does he do for a living?
I'm told I'm a lot like him.
Met my first girlfriend that way.
Do you read yet?
I feel like it's that way everywhere.
Well, thank you for being part of this study
That's why it's such like a big thing, because my uncle, he went, he went into the military and then came out.
Um, is the United States your, uh, birth country?
He also showed me the newspaper clipping.
Daddy, Daddy, Daddy send those girls to get those filthy cigarettes.
He could go and make more his self if he would get off his butt and do it.
Oh yes, yes they did.
We didn't get to spend any time with each other and just being married, and, you know, within a year or so or a year or two it was, um, Kim being unfamiliar with, with New York City and not really liking it very much.
We had a great big book of Grimm's Fairytales, and looking back on that they were grim!
Oh well that was Rosemary, her mother was gone.
Um, Christmas is coming up pretty soon huh?
And uh, I don't remember the specifics as to what he did, but the bus driver Louie was about four and a half feet tall driving a 72-passenger diesel bus.
Chased him all the way up to the upstairs, I don't think the bird ever even pooped in the house not that we found--
Yes, he said.
Or if they ever will at all?
How far away?
Daddy's, daddy's a builder right?
My father didn't read anything in terms of what you'd call a book, uh, but he was analytical of the Sport of Kings, and, so would peruse the paper to check on that . But, uh, my mother, uh, you know, didn't read a whole lot, but spent a lot of time reading to me, uh, my being an only child.
Just because, you know, she knows how I am, I guess.
West side of Charlotte.
So, that was such a racy and shocking book at that time, and so, of course, we had to read it.
That was the first time I saw them, the gue, the guerillas.
They didn't answer.
What how often.
All that day, we didn't get up (off the floor).
So, it's like she, uh, and the education wasn't the same back in those days.
And that keeps me, as an adult, one, remembering to pray like a child, and to maintain some of the innocence, which is difficult, of a child.
Are you sure you want to be telling people that?
And did you like living in Charlotte all your life?
Where is, where was this?
Then he came and we stayed on in the same place.
So I didn't like that at first, and then, of course, you know, as the story unfolded, you would, uh, relate that to your own experiences of being afraid and, and learning to conquer those fears and that kind of thing.
So they would, they would always come to me, and they told me, Ma'am, sell us milk, sell us yogurt, sell us cheese, or sell us a, a hog, a plump hog, well I had to sell them, and I am going to sell, he'd said, if you sell them to everyone else, sell to us, too.
Did you write this?
It's definitely grown.
Somewhere in VA Marsha sees a billboard for this restaurant to eat at.
If you're not from Charlotte, you're not going to know where that's at, but, um, it was really far away from everybody and behind the airport and stuff like that.
And you said, How do I get this tar off of me uncle?
I said to him, don't you know, Chepe, what it is?
You want to be down anymore than anybody else, so--
Well, you know, to this day every now and then that particular story comes up every now and then.
Do you remember any specific ones that you could retell?
We had a large tractor-trailer parked out front and uh, these guys all assembled to take the pews out of the church.
Let's see, recent authors You've probably never heard of any of these, but Gregory Benford is very good, these are science fiction, uh, see David Grant, science fiction that is real good.
OK Adam is now going to talk about the music industry.
And you where do you live now?
What does he do for a living?
Black cover with white, black and white.
And that keeps me, as an adult, one, remembering to pray like a child, and to maintain some of the innocence, which is difficult, of a child.
I don't, I kind of don't think about that though, because I'm like my life is my life, you know?
And she told me that everyone has to be like a little child to God, and that God loves everyone just like He is their own father and they are His children, because of what they are.
And I think that brings a smile to God's face.
Work a lot harder, um, take some classes that I think are going to interest me more.
Yes, he said.
The whole thing?
Where in Charlotte?
You got a job cutting siding wasn't it?
But, then like me and my mom will talk all the time and she'll come over here and she'll like have a beer and a cigarette with me and it doesn't matter anymore!
What do you do for that?
It was, and the little I remember, Momma telling me on the way, you know, just little things I don't know really, let me think now.
Did your dad read to you too?
Did your dad read to you too?
However, it didn't seem to be so horrifying.
Hmm, well , I had some teachers that were really, um, influential about what I read and their love for literature.
Do you have a playtime at school?
And did you like living in Charlotte all your life?
Well, let's see.
Because I'm like a lifeguard every summer and this year I had to get a winter job all year.
The music industry.
`Cause we're like, now I can say this because I'm older or whatever and I can like deal with it, I'm exactly like my dad.
Something to that effect.
Do you think that's a good thing that it helped culture you, or--
\\And you'll stay here?
And this is, I guess, after, after high school, kind of right before college, actually, while I was in college, before I went away to school, while I was still in Brooklyn.
Then he came and we stayed on in the same place.
And, uh, I assume, um, that English is your native language.
And I said, I don't have anybody, I said, hidden away.
You do numbers real fast?
So I remember silly things like that, that were a lot of fun . I read, uh, the story that, I don't, this isn't, ah, I think the first real story that I read was, uh, The Red Badge of Courage.
Because, well, no, Ines was putting up an argument that-, when he told her, No, he said, e, Luis Alonso, I may be going to die, he said, because so much blood loss, he said. 
Um, I don't think I'll be able to settle down here though, because most of my relatives live up north.
Do you think they've become more ex, do you think they've accepted more what you've decided to do or that's going to take a while?
And I said to some of my cousins that I had only the last I had seen was at Grandpop's funeral.
I look nobody is standing at the saw.
I went on through, unlocked the window and left.
We had a barn, a dairy farm that was maybe quarter of a mile from the house and uh, Mama say, We need milk.
How about um, your motorcycle?
Is there anything specific that, uh, you remember about your grandma?
she said, I mean, a huge group!
Um, I don't think I'll be able to settle down here though, because most of my relatives live up north.
It was a very interesting experience.
I just loved Cinderella . I also saw my sisters as the wicked stepsisters sometimes , and I was Cinderella, running around waiting on them.
Nothing I re, that I recall.
How about um, your kids?
So in some ways it was very similar to the space exploration that you were so interested in?
My favorite story, um, oh, Cinderella.
So now I'm going to run three pools over the summer.
He said, But, to take the livestock, I can't, I can't do it alone, at least, four, he said, because, it's difficult with the animals.
He said, Daddy I have to go poo-poo.
I like, uh, political non-fiction, and I've read The Making of the President series from 1960 on up.
Um, well I know it was before I was five, probably, I know at least four and I'm sure she read to me before that.
We were staying here in Albemarle.
They had bookshelves, um, that my daddy built, that were built in bookshelves and he um, they were filled up with books, and one summer, I remember when I was a teenager, I just made it a mission to read as many of those books as I could, and I plowed, they were fiction most of them.
What, ah, story in your childhood had the most impact on you?
And I couldn't, well, do anything else.
Do you think that's a good thing that it helped culture you, or--
What's your favorite?
And it was nice talking to you.
I had, had put in several weeks that were between 60 and 90 hours a week.
Um, I'm sure I have I just can't think of what.
He motioned to me as if they were going to cut off his head.
I, at that time I, she just called them hanks.
The music industry, well, you want more of the juicy, sordid details.
Yeah, I know he had on pants, he had on a long sleeve I think the cuffs were rolled up once or twice.
Now what about your mom?
Do you watch that?
I didn't do a lot of reading.
Of course it can't be published because all those things are copyrighted, but my mother made up the story and I thought it was very nice and I still have it, uh, handwritten, uh, in our file here.
Um, I read some of the same books that they had read to me, first, and then, as I got older, I just got hungry for books.
Well, as a teacher, do you see reading as something that is still important in families today?
Do you feel like that's a Southern thing or a NC thing, or--
Well, one day, I sai, I was going from San Miguel, uh, to Carolina, my brother lived, my brother was the principal of that, of that school there, in Carolina.
But it wasn't like Daddy's Little Wannabe Tomboy, thing anymore, you know.
I guess I want to say that it's been a real positive experience living here, because my, my mother really wants to move back up north because that's where she's from.
And it, it kind of makes me feel bad.
And they had to take him to a hospital right.
Um, I like this area a whole lot and it's, it's growing so much and I just want to be near my family so I can take care of them whenever they get older.
I liked that part.
It would be so damn foggy you could not see the yellow line on that divided highway in front of you and we to turn left out onto this highway.
They lived across the street from us in PA.
Black and white yeah.
Did you write this?
Why wouldn't you want to stay on Charlotte?
I mean I'm sure I have read I just can't even remember what, Dr. Zhivago, I read that.
I won't tell.
Walked through her bedroom around 6:30, seven o'clock in the morning you know.
I liked that part.
But it was a bunch of wild and crazy stories.
Hmm, well , I had some teachers that were really, um, influential about what I read and their love for literature.
And it, it kind of makes me feel bad.
What did you choose?
Where, where are you working now?
I've done horrible, let's just say horrible really, really bad.
Well thank you so much for letting me interview you.
I think uh-oh 200 pounds of mush going to be laying on the floor, I'll never get him up you know.
So when I graduate, more than likely I'll move to Boston, but Charlotte has definitely been a nice place to live.
How old are you talking about?
Um, she pretty much showed a lot of disinterest at best and, and outright hostility at worst towards my mom until we the kids came along.
Um, also a pothead, but not really so consumed with it necessarily.
Not really original, no, it was, uh, poems by well-known authors that you'd find in a book, but she had to memorize a lot of them, and she, but she read us children's poems, too, out of books, books that were written for children.
Is there anything else you want to--?
But I do got a 100 dollars.
I always had to get up early, milk the cows, and, uh, run, run them, as we say, because it's a, to the pastures, until times got pretty bad, and one day, I sent my daughter to, to the pasture to bring in the cows.
How about when you were in school?
Um, what do you remember any stories they told you, your parents told you?
Granddad had seen something one night.
she said, I mean, a huge group!
Is he your favorite superhero?
I can't think of anything, but it's been nice chatting with you.
I fact, I took you to Louisa May Alcott's home in Massachusetts, and we, ah, umm--.
And, and years later we ended up living in the place where that took place and the, uh, and it was not something that was, uh, not a subject that people liked to talk about because many of the people in town knew the young man who was charged with that murder.
They, they definitely had a lot of pride in, in the appearance of the studio and how well it was maintained, which was nice.
I love them all to death, but what they do, doesn't like reflect who I am--
Tell me about Batman.
No it was gas because you washed your legs all over because you did it in shorts.
It's one of the Little Golden?
Yeah on some of the songs yeah.
The message, again, that I get from the story, for me personally, was that there would always be a special connection between me and God, and actually was just another of the ways my grandmother put for me to learn, or believe, that I could do anything, I could be anything, because I had a special connection and special protection, um, from not only her, which was more important for me at the time.
So, early that morning, that afternoon, I came down from San Miguel, and I told him, I'm going to go.
Um, do you have a, one of those types of stories?
\\And you'll stay here?
What's your favorite?
Do you read Dr. Seuss?
And he said, Ma'am, he said, what did the guerrillas that were there eating do with themselves?
We learned all of those and the fairy tales, the classics, she read all of those to us.
We arrived, at my brother's, and Cristobal, with the livestock and the rest, still hadn't arrived.
I think she must have enjoyed it because she read them to us too.
So it's, it's written, as opposed to oral?
Well that window happened to be through her room, so I just kind of walked on through the room and she looked up at me and I said, Good morning, and she just screamed.
Well, who told you that story?
Is there a favorite story or storybook or anything that you had when you were little that somebody read to you?
They're actually both teachers.
I was four years old at the time.
So you feel like it's a southern thing?
You wrote this out all by yourself.
And how was growing up in Charlotte?
And the lion ate him.
Then the next day I don't know if you weren't there.
They're actually both teachers.
A carpenter.
It was a series of little fiction stories, and my mother must have read me every single one of them.
Anything else?
She had a washing machine but not, not a dryer so all the laundry get, got put hung out on the clothesline.
So, I'm kind of like the hope, I guess.
Before she died and she crashed on that curve.
Well that was for Dad.
Um, as a child, what did you like most about the story, as opposed to what you would like most about it now?
Um, not really anything unusual.
What kind of stories?
What are those stories?
Are they, like, rounded?
Well thank you so much for letting me interview you.
Uh, let's see.
I was four years old at the time.
What are those stories?
They, they definitely had a lot of pride in, in the appearance of the studio and how well it was maintained, which was nice.
First Grade.
Um, yes y'all need to include that picture with my little dysentery here, uh disinter, I guess it is.
What color is it?
Are you reading things?
I read a lot of other authors that weren't, weren't as good writers but also had interesting ideas.
So I guess they went that far.
A snowboard --.
OK, and your age?
\\ How \\, how come?
Of course it can't be published because all those things are copyrighted, but my mother made up the story and I thought it was very nice and I still have it, uh, handwritten, uh, in our file here.
Everybody's family is different.
And how old are you?
I didn't hit nothing.
I look out the window and there he's booking across the yard heading for the house.
Ooh, one of my three older sisters.
She remembered poems that she had learned when she was in high school.
So he says, No, from the school up, are all guerrillas.
I've, I've decided and it's very hard.
And she told me that everyone has to be like a little child to God, and that God loves everyone just like He is their own father and they are His children, because of what they are.
Is there anything specific that, uh, you remember about your grandma?
And do you feel like it was a good thing to grow up around?
What are those stories?
The whole thing?
Um, when you're talking about your favorite stories, what was your favorite part of the story?
I was four years old at the time.
On the monkey bars I used to swing up and get on top of it.
Are you close to your family?
She told him to shut-up and get her a pack of cigarettes.
Uh, well, would you care to relate the story to me now?
I, at that time I, she just called them hanks.
We'd basically coasted down into town and got about 50 gallons of kerosene and pumped it in the fuel tank so that so that the fuel would actually run through the fuel lines and the bus would run.
She got gangrene in her foot and he said if you don't quit smoking you're going to lose your foot.
Did you read this story itself, yourself, when you were young, or was it first told to you by someone?
Black and white yeah.
You have a good attitude about it, though!
Um, I'll definitely be ready for the change.
I said, Well we got some // gasoline.
It won't bother you, the cold weather and stuff?
I did that because that's what my dad wanted me to do.
How about um, your kids?
From there that was kind of frustrating me a little bit, going into, um, sessions every day or every night and having 15 people around me smoking fat blunts, drinking forties of Old English, and really not getting a whole lot of stuff done that was, it was, it was just depressing.
I liked those Disney World things.
Not any stories that she used to tell.
Have you ever read any books from foreign authors?
They would rather me stay in Nursing because they know that's where my heart is but, um, you know, they're behind me in whatever I decide to do.
They didn't answer.
I can, well you know we just relived the story today of when you built the house over on um, // Songbird.
Not really original, no, it was, uh, poems by well-known authors that you'd find in a book, but she had to memorize a lot of them, and she, but she read us children's poems, too, out of books, books that were written for children.
Do you ever tell this story yourself?
Na, that's the only one they told me.
OK, I said, So, how do we do it?
They're going to lessons for this and that, and sports, and they're playing interactive games with their computer and, uh, watching TV, and I think, really, they're not reading on their own, like maybe we did when I was that age because we didn't have all those other things to do.
She had a washing machine but not, not a dryer so all the laundry get, got put hung out on the clothesline.
Or do you feel like in general that's how high school is as opposed to college?
Plus, I really wasn't making the kind of connections that I wanted to make.
What did you enjoy about reading the Lewis and Clark journals?
Even though I had freedom when I was, you know, home, whatever, but I still had a curfew.
I've done horrible, let's just say horrible really, really bad.
OK, how about you Mom?
We learned all of those and the fairy tales, the classics, she read all of those to us.
And then, like now that I'm in college, like I call her, like all the time and it won't occur that I should talk to my dad, too!
Open the door, please.
// Even in the in, I mean NJ winters are really cold but--
So now I'm going to run three pools over the summer.
I can remember Mom and Dad saying Grandmom in the kitchen hollering, Daddy, Daddy, Daddy I wish you wouldn't talk like that in front of the girls.
If you help me, I said, to move my livestock to Chapeltique.
It's definitely grown.
\\And you'll stay here?
Then I said, Dear Lord, I said, what are we going to do about this?
Like because my dad always treated me like a boy because I was like I was the first girl on my dad's side of the family in like, four generations or something like that.
Work hard study balance your time, you know.
But uh, we hear a lot about home and how it used to be and like I said walking five miles to school and--
So, that was such a racy and shocking book at that time, and so, of course, we had to read it.
And your age?
Well, so many bullets, so many things.
Don't they do that a lot with like Britney Spears and people like that?
Uh, my mom took me for a it, um, doctor's visit uh, it was a physical.
I can, well you know we just relived the story today of when you built the house over on um, // Songbird.
Um, reading is fundamental as they say and it truly is.
How do they feel about your being a Theater major?
What, you said that you were four?
Well, as a teacher, do you see reading as something that is still important in families today?
I would like to look for a job in education, possibly teaching elementary school, um, hopefully up north I would rather do that up north, so--
Now that, that you're an adult obviously and have had children of your own what stories do you remember telling to your own children, and reading to your own children?
So in some ways it was very similar to the space exploration that you were so interested in?
It was, when the first one arrived, the first soldier, and he said, Er, ma'am, make, he said, some four, six rations, he said, because plenty of soldiers have come, and I'm going to inform the other houses.
Um, she pretty much showed a lot of disinterest at best and, and outright hostility at worst towards my mom until we the kids came along.
Lenient  --lenient, you know.
I was old enough at the time that I knew what was going on.
Uh, we used to sit on her back porch and uh snap uh beans or what they called doing snap beans, uh, which was really just taking green beans and snapping them into smaller pieces.
But uh, come mealtime boy this little apartment with central air conditioning running, the smoke hung about four and a half five feet down from the ceiling.
So in some ways it was very similar to the space exploration that you were so interested in?
We uh, we would run our safety drills at the elementary school.
Then they left, they left for the mountain, they went on up.
You got a job cutting siding wasn't it?
he said to me.
Uh, it was pretty much a kitchen a front room and two-bedroom house one bathroom.
My grandmom was pretty much a chain smoker.
That's good, though, you need to, I guess.
But I'm never going to take the knives out.
And did you find that to be kind of hard, or did, you know--?
How far away?
she said to them, because of you we're going to die too, through no fault of our own!
So it's almost like a second home.
The crate.
We brought them back in the afternoon, when I saw that, behind her there came a big group of, they looked like soldiers, but in street clothes.
However, it didn't seem to be so horrifying.
My grandmom was pretty much a chain smoker.
You wrote this out all by yourself.
For North Carolina?
Um, I'll definitely be ready for the change.
Throwing up.
I like, uh, political non-fiction, and I've read The Making of the President series from 1960 on up.
Then I said, Dear Lord, I said, what are we going to do about this?
Do you think that's what it was?
What does he do?
He also showed me the newspaper clipping.
He could go and make more his self if he would get off his butt and do it.
We would all slide the windows down on the bus open the door, stick your head out the door, you couldn't hear anything coming that way, you couldn't hear anything coming the other way, and he'd just drop it in low and gun it, we would make it another morning.
Now you watch a lot of television don't you?
And they put out the, the word that yes, they had killed him.
I remember going down to the church and there was a group of men there that were organizing an uh, evacuation of all the valuables of the church, take them to the second floor.
Yeah I had to take it, as children?
Because they were living in a, in an apartment basically.
You shouldn't drink that non-pasteurized milk, but hey, it never hurt us.
Smacked my chest.
Um, well, let's see, so do you think that those experiences helped you figure out the kinds of things you liked to read?
I firmly am committed to that.
It's just one of those things, you know that happened.
That sounds like fun.
Um, now why did you decide to stay in Charlotte to go to school?
How old were you when she shared this story with you?
When was that?
So, I said, No, I said, I'm not going to be able to go.
It's a relatively painless experience and not very cumbersome to deal with, not bad.
You know what?
Did he ever tell you any other stories?
Five years.
What did you choose?
I guess one of the other authors I like a lot uh is C.S.
Is he your favorite superhero?
So now I'm going to run three pools over the summer.
Umm, go ahead and tell me about a story.
Throwing up.
Every time we stop I want you to get off and let whoever I'm letting on, in and then you get back in, sit on the step.
I just can't remember.
Well, who told you that story?
Uh, it's interesting how, uh, stories become so impressionable the younger the hearer.
I feel like it's that way everywhere.
\\ They wasn't ghosts.
I have nobody here to guide me.
Well, he milked the cow every morning, but that day, he couldn't milk her, because the gunfire was so heavy, and because everything was falling near the house.
Do you remember the names of any of them?
How was it going to high school in Charlotte?
Your mother wasn't real happy about that.
The bull start making his noises and all that other stuff.
It's just one of those things that you know, you just don't think people want to hear much about these days.
My mom believes me, because she knows I'll go.
I don't remember, but only, only a fractured collarbone, which I recommend to anyone that needs to break a bone, break a collarbone.
It's not a family story.
Actually, my sister wrote a story on it.
We had a large tractor-trailer parked out front and uh, these guys all assembled to take the pews out of the church.
Like in most schools in Charlotte, if you go on other sides, it's like everybody's just white, but in my school, there was every kind of person you could ever meet.
Do feel like it's changed a lot?
So they would, they would always come to me, and they told me, Ma'am, sell us milk, sell us yogurt, sell us cheese, or sell us a, a hog, a plump hog, well I had to sell them, and I am going to sell, he'd said, if you sell them to everyone else, sell to us, too.
`Cause we're like, now I can say this because I'm older or whatever and I can like deal with it, I'm exactly like my dad.
Do you remember little Pierre?
She would save everything.
So, early that morning, that afternoon, I came down from San Miguel, and I told him, I'm going to go.
I, I do think they read to them when they are little.
Daddy, Daddy, Daddy send those girls to get those filthy cigarettes.
It was, when the first one arrived, the first soldier, and he said, Er, ma'am, make, he said, some four, six rations, he said, because plenty of soldiers have come, and I'm going to inform the other houses.
Well, it wasn't light yet when the gunfire starts.
I read everything I could get my hands on.
So that helped you learn about people that you had not necessarily met.
Does he ever let you drive the car?
Is it like a gun?
And so what year does that make you, are you a--?
Do you read yet?
These are dead people that are--
The message, again, that I get from the story, for me personally, was that there would always be a special connection between me and God, and actually was just another of the ways my grandmother put for me to learn, or believe, that I could do anything, I could be anything, because I had a special connection and special protection, um, from not only her, which was more important for me at the time.
And, um, my junior year of high sch, high school, we moved into like the city, the west side of Charlotte, and I went to West Meck, and that was a, um, culture experience, \\ I guess \\.
I was always into those kinds of heroic things, um, so I read a lot of those things.
And uh, me and my friend there we'd always sit together in the first or second seat on the bus.
And how they use to take their lunches to school and some of the things they took for lunch like fatback meat biscuits and--.
And I said to him, I'm not going to be able to go.
All my digits um, still work.
Or if they ever will at all?
I just can't remember.
No it hasn't because my grades are still pretty bad.
 We always had books lots of books.
Um, I guess the time when I was four.
And I couldn't, well, do anything else.
Tell me about Batman.
Who would have been telling you those stories?
If you help me, I said, to move my livestock to Chapeltique.
Well, it would probably been things like living back in the hills of TN and having to ride a mule to school, things like that.
And I said to him, I'm not going to be able to go.
We brought them back in the afternoon, when I saw that, behind her there came a big group of, they looked like soldiers, but in street clothes.
Another book that I read recently is very interesting books The Journals of Lewis and Clark.
Did you write this?
( ) When cancer comes up I'm just pretty, pretty interested in it, to find out what they went through and I can relate to it.
Well, this story, and I must tell you, I haven't read this in The Bible, so I don't know if it's totally accurate, but I prefer to get it like  There was a huge crowd of people, and, um, Jesus decided that what he wanted to do was to, uh, entertain the little children.
You know what?
Well, and I forgot to tell you when the soldiers came, to my house, the guerrillas were there, the guerrillas went back.
And so, uh, those things come about through the work of reading rather than through listening to some person on the street corner or, uh, gazing on TV.
He could go and make more his self if he would get off his butt and do it.
I said, Well you can use paint thinner or turpentine or gasoline.
He said, Daddy I have to go poo-poo.
Daddy, Daddy, Daddy send those girls to get those filthy cigarettes.
Tell me about Batman.
Elbert, I just want to ask you uh, some questions about your experience with uh, stories.
That's good, though, you need to, I guess.
Actually my first semester at Charlotte, I was a Pre-Business major to go into Marketing and Advertising, because I did that in high school, too.
And uh, I don't remember the specifics as to what he did, but the bus driver Louie was about four and a half feet tall driving a 72-passenger diesel bus.
They're making trincheras, they call them trincheras, where they're putting mounds of stones near the houses, so that the bullets there.
And your age?
Do you enjoy--?
That's why it's such like a big thing, because my uncle, he went, he went into the military and then came out.
Because they're going to set up a committee, he said to me, so that when those big battalions, he said to me, of guerrillas arrive, these people attend, for example, the president is going to talk to the rest so that they all get food together for them.
I just kept reading until I finally had read almost every one of them.
Um, reading is fundamental as they say and it truly is.
I just really didn't ever love poetry for some reason.
Everybody's family is different.
Are you going to get gifts for anyone this year?
Uh, it's interesting how, uh, stories become so impressionable the younger the hearer.
Are you going to buy any gifts for people or make anything?
Do you remember the names of any of them?
He had a pillow, one of those big pillows, and it looked red, all of it with blood and swollen like this . So he said, from the running down from several places, but the one that, this one [indicates eyebrow], was, was too much.
You did a really good job.
And your age?
Did you identify with any of these characters?
We lived between, between the border of Honduras and El Salvador.
Um, my mom has because she knows how important it is to me and everything like that and my dad actually two weeks ago when I went home, I don't even remember why I went home, but I went home for something and he's like, he's still trying to convince me to double major.
I know about that!
Uh, we used to walk up to the local grocery store, uh, which was about three or four blocks away.
The book just tied right into it.
Well, because it was really interesting stuff.
They took out all the rest (of the shrapnel), but the one in his eyebrow, they couldn't get it out.
Um, not too many stories about my dad's childhood.
I guess I want to say that it's been a real positive experience living here, because my, my mother really wants to move back up north because that's where she's from.
I read a lot of other authors that weren't, weren't as good writers but also had interesting ideas.
And then, like now that I'm in college, like I call her, like all the time and it won't occur that I should talk to my dad, too!
Ooh, one of my three older sisters.
And what's your major?
And it was one afternoon I was out playing on the uh, sidewalk and uh Mom was, Mom was in the kitchen doing something and I was, I guess pretending to act like a salesman and I went up to the front door and rang the doorbell.
Oh well, the cultural differences would come through in the writing, yeah, sure.
Thank, thank you for your stories.
Granddad had seen something one night.
But if we didn't want to work with them, we shouldn't get them into anything with the mil, military, such as, informing on them, or something like that.
And, anyway, uh, anyway, went on from there, started doing a lot of stuff in college working with um one person specifically.
And, um, I just wish that my counselor would have been more helpful to me.
Um, I guess the only story that they ever say a lot about my grandmother was the fact that she did not like my mom when uh my father and she first got together.
I guess I lay there unconscious awhile.
It's kind of a, which is the cause and which is the effect, question.
And I said, I don't have anybody, I said, hidden away.
She waits tables like one night a week at another job to help put me through and everything like that.
And do you read a lot?
Yeah I had to take it, as children?
He also showed me the newspaper clipping.
Do you think that's what it was?
You can go out on the weekends but during the week it, you know, it should be study time.
I always had to get up early, milk the cows, and, uh, run, run them, as we say, because it's a, to the pastures, until times got pretty bad, and one day, I sent my daughter to, to the pasture to bring in the cows.
Well, one day, I sai, I was going from San Miguel, uh, to Carolina, my brother lived, my brother was the principal of that, of that school there, in Carolina.
Then the next day I don't know if you weren't there.
The music industry, well, you want more of the juicy, sordid details.
What about high school into college into adulthood what are some of the books that you read?
I would just scream and scream you know that, No, no, don't do that.
My cousin's.
Hold it as long as you can.
It's a relatively painless experience and not very cumbersome to deal with, not bad.
All The Little Monster Books, I can't remember what the individual names of them were but I've read them all multiple times.
Did you have lots of storybooks at your house that were read to you?
And I think that brings a smile to God's face.
They hid and, the soldiers came to the house.
Well, my brother had a, cow, tied out, and a goat, the cow's offspring.
And did you like living in Charlotte all your life?
I would just scream and scream you know that, No, no, don't do that.
Um, I guess the only story that they ever say a lot about my grandmother was the fact that she did not like my mom when uh my father and she first got together.
What color is it?
I still read history.
Which is really a story from beginning to end, I suppose.
It's such a handicap not to read.
Like when I lived at home, we did not get along at all for anything in the world; we would fight all the time.
That's the way, way it was, they're big, plenty, if I were to tell you all the stories of what we went through, I tell you, that I'd keep you all night . That's how it was, it was said, but thank God in the family hardly-- The guerrillas also took out a man from the outskirts near the, the place where we lived, who was called Juan.
Why wouldn't you want to stay on Charlotte?
They were, um, they were best-seller type fiction from the um, 40's and 50's and 60's and on, just, they were members of a book club and they got a lot of books that way.
